02c9e59a-19bd-4a41-ac58-585371ff56fe	pathogens	Correspondence: bobadillaml@gmail.comThis article belongs to the Special Issue Latest Advances in Human Papillomavirus (HPV) Research.Cervical cancer is a global health concern and ranks fourth among the most prevalent cancers in women worldwide. Human papillomavirus (HPV) infection is a known precursor of cervical cancer and preventive measures include prophylactic vaccines. This study focused on sexually active Paraguayan women aged 18–25 years, exploring the intersection of HPV vaccination and sexual behavior. Among 254 participants, 40.9% received the Gardasil-4 vaccine, with no significant differences in sexual behavior between the vaccinated and unvaccinated sexually active groups. However, a notable decrease in the prevalence of HPV among the vaccinated women highlights the efficacy of this vaccine in reducing infections. The prevalence of any HPV type was 37.5% in vaccinated participants compared to 56.7% in unvaccinated participants (p = 0.0026). High-risk HPV types showed a significant difference, with a prevalence of 26.0% in vaccinated women compared with 52.7% in unvaccinated women (p < 0.001). Although a potential decline in genital warts was observed among the vaccinated individuals, statistical significance (p = 0.0564) was not reached. Despite the challenges in achieving high vaccination coverage, the observed reduction in HPV prevalence underscores the importance of ongoing monitoring, healthcare professional recommendations, and comprehensive risk management. These findings contribute to dispelling concerns about HPV vaccination influencing sexual behavior, advocating further large-scale research to explore the impact of vaccines on various HPV types and potential cross-protection.Consejo Nacional de Ciencia y TecnologíaPrograma Paraguayo para el Desarrollo de la Ciencia y Tecnología. Proyectos de investigación y desarroll The rise in international trade of plants and plant products has increased the risk of introduction and spread of plant pathogens and pests. In addition, new risks are arising from the implementation of more environmentally friendly methods of biodegradable waste disposal, such as composting and anaerobic digestion. As these disposal methods do not involve sterilisation, there is good evidence that certain plant pathogens and pests can survive these processes. The temperature/time profile of the disposal process is the most significant and easily defined factor in controlling plant pathogens and pests. In this review, the current evidence for temperature/time effects on plant pathogens and pests is summarised. The advantages and disadvantages of direct and indirect process validation for the verification of composting processes, to determine their efficacy in destroying plant pathogens and pests in biowaste, are discussed. The availability of detection technology and its appropriateness for assessing the survival of quarantine organisms is also reviewed Objective: Climate change is likely to affect the nature of pathogens and chemicals in the environment and their fate and transport. Future risks of pathogens and chemicals could therefore be very different from those of today. In this review, we assess the implications of climate change for changes in human exposures to pathogens and chemicals in agricultural systems in the United Kingdom and discuss the subsequent effects on health impacts.     Data sources: In this review, we used expert input and considered literature on climate change ; health effects resulting from exposure to pathogens and chemicals arising from agriculture ; inputs of chemicals and pathogens to agricultural systems ; and human exposure pathways for pathogens and chemicals in agricultural systems.     Data synthesis: We established the current evidence base for health effects of chemicals and pathogens in the agricultural environment ; determined the potential implications of climate change on chemical and pathogen inputs in agricultural systems ; and explored the effects of climate change on environmental transport and fate of different contaminant types. We combined these data to assess the implications of climate change in terms of indirect human exposure to pathogens and chemicals in agricultural systems. We then developed recommendations on future research and policy changes to manage any adverse increases in risks.     Conclusions: Overall, climate change is likely to increase human exposures to agricultural contaminants. The magnitude of the increases will be highly dependent on the contaminant type. Risks from many pathogens and particulate and particle-associated contaminants could increase significantly. These increases in exposure can, however, be managed for the most part through targeted research and policy changes Kinetoplastids are a group of flagellated protozoans that include the species Trypanosoma and Leishmania, which are human pathogens with devastating health and economic effects. The sequencing of the genomes of some of these species has highlighted their genetic relatedness and underlined differences in the diseases that they cause. As we discuss in this Review, steady progress using a combination of molecular, genetic, immunologic, and clinical approaches has substantially increased understanding of these pathogens and important aspects of the diseases that they cause. Consequently, the paths for developing additional measures to control these “neglected diseases” are becoming increasingly clear, and we believe that the opportunities for developing the drugs, diagnostics, vaccines, and other tools necessary to expand the armamentarium to combat these diseases have never been better Mastitis in dairy cows is a significant economic and animal welfare issue in the dairy industry. The bacterial pathogens responsible for infection of the mammary gland may be split into two main categories: major and minor pathogens. Infection with major pathogens generally results in clinical illness or strong inflammatory responses and reduced milk yields, whereas minor pathogen infection is usually subclinical. Previous investigations have considered the transmission of these pathogens independently. Experimental evidence has shown cross-protection between species of pathogens. In this study a mathematical model for the coupled transmission of major and minor pathogens along with their interaction via the host was developed in order to consider various methods for controlling the incidence of major pathogen infection. A stability analysis of the model equilibria provides explanations for observed phenomena and previous decoupled modelling results. This multispecies model structure has provided a basis for quantifying the extent of cross-protection between species and assessing possible control strategies against the disease The global focus on wildlife as a major contributor to emerging pathogens and infectious diseases (EIDs) in humans and domestic animals is not based on field, experimental or dedicated research, but mostly on limited surveys of literature, opinion and the assumption that biodiversity harbours pathogens. The perceived and direct impacts of wildlife, from being a reservoir of certain human and livestock pathogens and as a risk to health, are frequently overstated when compared to the Global burden of disease statistics available from WHO, OIE and FAO. However organisms that evolve in wildlife species can and do spill-over into human landscapes and humans and domestic animal population and, where these organisms adapt to surviving and spreading amongst livestock and humans, these emerging infections can have significant consequences. Drivers for the spill-over of pathogens or evolution of organisms from wildlife reservoirs to become pathogens of humans and domestic animals are varied but almost without exception poorly researched. The changing demographics, spatial distribution and movements, associated landscape modifications (especially agricultural) and behavioural changes involving human and domestic animal populations are probably the core drivers of the apparent increasing trend in emergence of new pathogens and infectious diseases over recent decades	['159441153', '233101', '233233', '130508', '232967', '10125828']	[[{'name': 'Araya, Soraya Angela Lorenza'}, {'name': 'Bobadilla Frizzola, María Liz'}, {'name': 'Castro, Héctor'}, {'name': 'Deluca, Gerardo'}, {'name': 'Salete de Paula, Vanessa'}, {'name': 'Villagra, Veronica'}, {'name': 'Von-Horoch, Marta'}], [{'name': 'Budge, G.

0f2c07fa-b173-4c3f-8d2f-1be3e96ab181	shocks	We report on the radio-emission characteristics of 222 interplanetary (IP) shocks. A surprisingly large fraction of the IP shocks (~34%) is radio quiet (i.e., the shocks lacked type II radio bursts). The CMEs associated with the RQ shocks are generally slow (average speed ~535 km/s) and only ~40% of the CMEs were halos. The corresponding numbers for CMEs associated with radio loud (RL) shocks are 1237 km/s and 72%, respectively. The RQ shocks are also accompanied by lower peak soft X-ray flux. CMEs associated with RQ (RL) shocks are generally accelerating (decelerating). The kinematics of CMEs associated with the km type II bursts is similar to those of RQ shocks, except that the former are slightly more energetic. Comparison of the shock The RQ shocks seem to be mostly subcritical and quasi-perpendicular. The radio-quietness is predominant in the rise phase and decreases through the maximum and declining phases of solar cycle 23. The solar sources of the shock-driving CMEs follow the sunspot butterfly diagram, consistent with the higher-energy requirement for driving shocks We study products of precursors of spatially local operators, $W_{x_{n}}(t_{n}) ... W_{x_1}(t_1)$, where $W_x(t) = e^{-iHt} W_x e^{iHt}$. Using chaotic spin-chain numerics and gauge/gravity duality, we show that a single precursor fills a spatial region that grows linearly in $t$. In a lattice system, products of such operators can be represented using tensor networks. In gauge/gravity duality, they are related to Einstein-Rosen bridges supported by localized shock waves. We find a geometrical correspondence between these two descriptions, generalizing earlier work in the spatially homogeneous case.Comment: 23 pages plus appendices, 12 figures. v2: minor error in Appendix B   corrected. v3: figure added to the introduction comparing the butterfly   effect cone with the standard light con It is shown, concerning equivalent classes, that on a one-dimensional lattice with nearest neighbor interaction, there are only four independent models possessing double-shocks. Evolution of the width of the double-shocks in different models is investigated. Double-shocks may vanish, and the final state is a state with no shock. There is a model for which at large times the average width of double-shocks will become smaller. Although there may exist stationary single-shocks in nearest neighbor reaction diffusion models, it is seen that in none of these models, there exist any stationary double-shocks. Models admitting multi-shocks are classified, and the large time behavior of multi-shock solutions is also investigated.Comment: 17 pages, LaTeX2e, minor revisio Collisionless shocks occur in various fields of physics. In the context of space and astrophysics they have been investigated for many decades. However, a thorough understanding of shock formation and particle acceleration is still missing. Collisionless shocks can be distinguished into electromagnetic and electrostatic shocks. Electromagnetic shocks are of importance mainly in astrophysical environments and they are mediated by the Weibel or filamentation instability. In such shocks, charged particles gain energy by diffusive shock acceleration. Electrostatic shocks are characterized by a strong electrostatic field, which leads to electron trapping. Ions are accelerated by reflection from the electrostatic potential. Shock formation and particle acceleration will be discussed in theory and simulations Commonly used instruments for the identification of monetary policy disturbances are likely to combine the true policy shock with information about the state of the economy due to the information disclosed through the policy action. We show that this signalling effect of monetary policy can give rise to the empirical puzzles reported in the literature, and propose a new high-frequency instrument for monetary policy shocks that accounts for informational rigidities. We find that a monetary tightening is unequivocally contractionary, with deterioration of domestic demand, labor and credit market conditions, as well as of asset prices and agents' expectations This paper studies output fluctuations in a panel of OECD economies with the aim to decompose the evolution in output volatility into domestic and international factors. To this end we use a factor-augmented dynamic panel model with both domestic and international shocks and spillovers between countries through trade linkages. Changes in the volatility of output growth can be due to a time-varying sensitivity to these shocks, changes in the propagation mechanism or shifts in the variances of shocks. We explicitly model cross-sectional dependence in the variance equation by specifying a common factor structure in the volatility of domestic shocks. The results show that while the size of international shocks and spillovers does not decrease in most countries, the volatilities of domestic shocks share a clear common decreasing trend. Hence, the 'Great Moderation' appears to be mainly driven by a decline in the volatility of domestic shocks rather than smaller international shocks This paper examines the transmission of income inequality into consumption inequality and in  so doing investigates the degree of insurance to income shocks. Panel data on income from the  PSID is combined with consumption data from repeated CEX cross-sections to identify the degree  of insurance to permanent and transitory shocks. In the process we also present new evidence of  the growth in the variance of permanent and transitory shocks in the US during the 1980s. We find  some partial insurance of permanent income shocks with more insurance possibilities for the college  educated and those nearing retirement. We find little evidence against full insurance for transitory  income shocks except among low income households. Tax and welfare benefits are found to play  an important role in insuring permanent shocks. Adding durable expenditures to the consumption  measure suggests that durable replacement is an important insurance mechanism, especially for  transitory income shocks	['677743', '17227812', '921461', '18094909', '76808113', '37977463', '138010226']	[[{'name': 'Burgess'}, {'name': 'Cliver'}, {'name': 'Gopalswamy'}, {'name': 'Gopalswamy'}, {'name': 'Gopalswamy'}, {'name': 'Gopalswamy'}, {'name': 'Gopalswamy'}, {'name': 'Gopalswamy'}, {'name': 'Gopalswamy'}, {'name': 'Gopalswamy'}, {'name': 'Gopalswamy'}, {'name': 'Gopalswamy'}, {'name': 'Gopalswamy'}, {'name': 'H.

Vegetative and reproductive structures of 34 mangrove species that are readily observed in the field are emphasized and presented in color photographs and as graphic icons. Also discussed: importance of mangroves; mangrove decline and legislation; conservation and rehabilitation; and mangrove-friendly aquaculture Chromolaena odorata is commonly known as Siam weed which belongs to sunflower family Asteraceae. C. odorata is an important medicinal plant which can be easily found in tropical Asia, West Africa, and parts of Australia. It is native to the America, and found in Florida and Texas in the United States, throughout Mexico and the Caribbean to South America. The medicinal usage of C. odorata has been reported in the traditional systems of medicine such as Ayurveda, Siddha, and Unani. It has wide variety of ethanomedicinal and pharmacological properties. The young leaves are crushed, and the resulting liquid can be used to treat skin wounds. The leaves extract is used by the kani tribals of Kouthalai in Tirunelveli hills to cure skin diseases, poison bites, wounds, and rheumatism. Following various folk claims for the ailment of various diseases, efforts have been made by the researchers to verify the efficacy of this weed through scientific biological screenings. A study of the literature revealed some notable pharmacological activities of the shrub such as anthelmintic, antimalarial, analgesic, anti-inflammatory, antipyretic, antispasmodic, antioxidant, antigonorrheal, antimycobacterial, insecticidal, fungicidal, wound healing, diuretic, blood coagulation, and antibacterial.

The critical connectivity is found numerically by examining the size of the largest cluster. We derive an analytical expression for the cluster coefficient which shows that the graphs are distinctly different from standard random graphs, even for infinite dimensionality. Insights relevant for graph bi-partitioning are included.Comment: 16 pages, 10 figures. Minor changes. Added reference We show that for each $r\ge 4$, in a density range extending up to, and slightly beyond, the threshold for a $K_r$-factor, the copies of $K_r$ in the random graph $G(n,p)$ are randomly distributed, in the (one-sided) sense that the hypergraph that they form contains a copy of a binomial random hypergraph with almost exactly the right density. Thus, an asymptotically sharp bound for the threshold in Shamir's hypergraph matching problem -- recently announced by Jeff Kahn -- implies a corresponding bound for the threshold for $G(n,p)$ to contain a $K_r$-factor. We also prove a slightly weaker result for $r=3$, and (weaker) generalizations replacing $K_r$ by certain other graphs $F$. As an application of the latter we find, up to a log factor, the threshold for $G(n,p)$ to contain an $F$-factor when $F$ is $1$-balanced but not strictly $1$-balanced.Comment: 19 pages; expanded introduction and Section 5, plus minor correction We study the mixing properties of the single-site Markov chain known as the Glauber dynamics for sampling $k$-colorings of a sparse random graph $G(n,d/n)$ for constant $d$. The best known rapid mixing results for general graphs are in terms of the maximum degree $\Delta$ of the input graph $G$ and hold when $k>11\Delta/6$ for all $G$. Improved results hold when $k>\alpha\Delta$ for graphs with girth $\geq 5$ and $\Delta$ sufficiently large where $\alpha\approx 1.7632\ldots$ is the root of $\alpha=\exp(1/\alpha)$; further improvements on the constant $\alpha$ hold with stronger girth and maximum degree assumptions. For sparse random graphs the maximum degree is a function of $n$ and the goal is to obtain results in terms of the expected degree $d$. The following rapid mixing results for $G(n,d/n)$ hold with high probability over the choice of the random graph for sufficiently large constant~$d$. Mossel and Sly (2009) proved rapid mixing for constant $k$, and Efthymiou (2014) improved this to $k$ linear in~$d$. The condition was improved to $k>3d$ by Yin and Zhang (2016) using non-MCMC methods. Here we prove rapid mixing when $k>\alpha d$ where $\alpha\approx 1.7632\ldots$ is the same constant as above. Moreover we obtain $O(n^{3})$ mixing time of the Glauber dynamics, while in previous rapid mixing results the exponent was an increasing function in $d$. As in previous results for random graphs our proof analyzes an appropriately defined block dynamics to "hide" high-degree vertices. One new aspect in our improved approach is utilizing so-called local uniformity properties for the analysis of block dynamics. To analyze the "burn-in" phase we prove a concentration inequality for the number of disagreements propagating in large blocks Spin models on quenched random graphs are related to many important optimization problems. We give a new derivation of their mean-field equations that elucidates the role of the natural order parameter in these models.Comment: 9 pages, report CPTH-A264.109 A generalization of the random geometric graph (RGG) model is proposed by considering a set of points uniformly and independently distributed on a rectangle of unit area instead of on a unit square [0,1]^2. The topological properties of the random rectangular graphs (RRGs) generated by this model are then studied as a function of the rectangle sides lengths a and b=1/a, and the radius r used to connect the nodes. When a=1 we recover the RGG, and when a-->infinity the very elongated rectangle generated resembles a one-dimensional RGG. We obtain here analytical expressions for the average degree, degree distribution, connectivity, average path length and clustering coefficient for RRG. These results provide evidence that show that most of these properties depend on the connection radius and the side length of the rectangle, usually in a monotonic way. The clustering coefficient, however, increases when the square is transformed into a slightly elongated rectangle, and after this maximum it decays with the increase of the elongation of the rectangle. We support all our findings by computational simulations that show the goodness of the theoretical models proposed for RRGs.Comment: 23 pages, 8 figure Random graphs have proven to be one of the most important and fruitful concepts in modern Combinatorics and Theoretical Computer Science. Besides being a fascinating study subject for their own sake, they serve as essential instruments in proving an enormous number of combinatorial statements, making their role quite hard to overestimate. Their tremendous success serves as a natural motivation for the following very general and deep informal questions: what are the essential properties of random graphs? How can one tell when a given graph behaves like a random graph? How to create deterministically graphs that look random-like? This leads us to a concept of pseudo-random graphs and the aim of this survey is to provide a systematic treatment of this concept.Comment: 50 page Inspired by a concept in comparative genomics, we investigate properties of randomly chosen members of G_1(m,n,t), the set of bipartite graphs with $m$ left vertices, n right vertices, t edges, and each vertex of degree at least one. We give asymptotic results for the number of such graphs and the number of $(i,j)$ trees they contain. We compute the thresholds for the emergence of a giant component and for the graph to be connected	['886853', '49549211', '43121414', '1042641', '18041325', '1081086', '1076184']	[[{'name': 'Bernardo A.

1df0444f-0adb-4976-a2a9-bdfe44a14498	thesis	This research focuses on the design of pattern reconfigurable antennas and the associated circuitry. The proposed pattern reconfigurable antenna designs benefit from advantages such as maximum pattern diversity and optimum switching circuits to realise 5G reconfigurable antennas. Whereas MIMO based solutions can provide increased channel capacity, they demand high computational capability and power consumption due to multiple channel processing. This prevents their use in many applications most notably in the Internet of Things where power consumption is of key importance. A switched-beam diversity allows an energy-efficient solution improving the link budget even for small low-cost battery operated IoT/sensor network applications. The main focus of the antenna reconfiguration in this work is for switched-beam diversity. The fundamental switching elements are discussed including basic PIN diode circuits. Techniques to switch the antenna element in the feed or shorting the antenna element to the ground plane are presented. A back-to-back microstrip patch antenna with two hemispherical switchable patterns is proposed. The patch elements on a common ground plane, are switched with a single-pole double-throw PIN diode circuit. Switching the feed selects either of two identical oppositely oriented radiation patterns for maximum diversity in one plane. The identical design of the antenna elements provides similar performance control of frequency and radiation pattern in different states. This antenna provides a simple solution to cross-layer PIN diode circuit designs. A mirrored structure study provides an understanding of performance control for different switching states. A printed inverted-F antenna is presented for monopole reconfigurable antenna design. The proposed low-profile antenna consists of one main radiator and one parasitic element. By shorting the parasitic element to the ground plane using only one PIN diode, the antenna is capable of switching both the pattern and polarisation across the full bandwidth. The switched orthogonal pattern provides the maximum spatial pattern diversity and is realised using a simple structure. Then, a dual-stub coplanar Vivaldi antenna with a parasitic element is presented for the 5G mm-Wave band. The use of a dual-stub coupled between the parasitic element and two tapered slots is researched. The parasitic element shape and size is optimised to increase the realised gain. A bandpass coupled line filter is used for frequency selective features. The use of slits on the outer edge of the ground plane provides a greater maximum gain. This integrated filtenna offers lower insertion loss than the commercial DC blocks. The UWB antenna with an integrated filter can be used for harmonic suppression. The influence of the integrated filter circuit close to the antenna geometry informs the design of PIN diode circuit switching and power supply in the 5G band. Based on the filter design in the mm-Wave band, a method of designing a feasible DC power supply for the PIN diode in the mm-Wave band is studied. A printed Yagi-Uda antenna array is integrated with switching circuitry to realise a switched 180° hemispheres radiation pattern. The antenna realises a maximum diversity in one plane. The study offers the possibility to use PIN diodes in the mm-Wave band for reconfigurable antenna designs. For the presented antennas, key geometric parameters are discussed for improved understanding of the trade-offs in radiation pattern/beamwidth and gain control for reconfigurable antenna applications Fraxinus excelsior (common ash) is a hardwood tree, native to Ireland which has demonstrated adaptability to growing in a wide range of sites. In 2013, there was a total of over 20,000 hectares recorded under ash in Ireland. From an economic, ecological and carbon aspect ash is also a very important tree species. Since the arrival of Chalara disease, which has the potential to prove fatal to c.97% of the ash population there is an urgent need to consider how to preserve the remaining resistant trees and propagate new resistant lines. Grafting is the suggested method which has the capacity to produce a tree in a breeding programme which can be field planted within a year, once suitable rootstocks can be determined and produced. This thesis examined the potential for grafting two Fraxinus excelsior clones M72 and 98, chosen at random onto F. excelsior, F. paxiana, F. chinensis, F. japonica, F. platypoda, Syringa vulgaris, and Ligustrum ovalifolium rootstocks to confirm their suitability for large scale vegetative propagation. It was found that when Clone M72 and Clone 98 were grafted onto Fraxinus excelsior rootstocks the survival was 100% and 97% respectively, while the non-grafted Control returned a plant survival rate of 93%. When Clone M72 was grafted onto Fraxinus chinensis and Fraxinus paxiana rootstocks the resultant graft survival was 68% and 40% respectively. When Fraxinus platypoda and Fraxinus japonica interstocks were used for grafting Clone 98 survival was 87% and 60% respectively. When Ligustrum and Syringa rootstocks were used to propagate Clone M72 survival was 37% and 33% respectively. When Ligustrum and Syringa were used as rootstocks for Clone 98 the result was 30% and 40% respectively. Propagation by budding was not successful The mortgage arrears crisis in Ireland was and is among the most severe experienced on record and although there has been a decreasing trend in the number of mortgages in default in the past four years, it still continues to cause distress to borrowers and vulnerabilities to lenders. There are indications that one of the main factors associated with mortgage default is loan affordability, of which the level of disposable income is a driver. Additionally, guidelines set out by the European Central Bank instructed financial institutions to adopt measures to further reduce and prevent loans defaulting, including the implementation and identification of Early Warning Indicators (EWIs). Financial institutions currently adopt credit risk models in order to calculate the risk associated with customers. Therefore, this research observed a cohort of mortgage customers in Lender A over a 30-month period and utilised transactional features, explaining the use of disposable income, to expand on existing credit risk models and aid in the identification of EWIs for the mortgage portfolio. Over the course of the study three feature selection techniques were adopted, namely correlation-based analysis, random forest feature importance and decision tree feature importance. A number of transactional categories were identified including insurance spend, gambling spend, savings and the value of ATM withdrawals. Furthermore, it was found that the inclusion of transactional features in existing credit risk models statistically improved performance A system is presented here to provide improved precision in ensemble differential photometry. This is achieved by using the power of grid computing to analyse astronomical catalogues. This produces new catalogues of optimised pointings for each star, which maximise the number and quality of reference stars available. Astronomical phenomena such as exoplanet transits and small-scale structure within quasars may be observed by means of millimagnitude photometric variability on the timescale of minutes to hours. Because of atmospheric distortion, ground-based observations of these phenomena require the use of differential photometry whereby the target is compared with one or more reference stars. CCD cameras enable the use of many reference stars in an ensemble. The more closely the reference stars in this ensemble resemble the target, the greater the precision of the photometry that can be achieved. The Locus Algorithm has been developed to identify the optimum pointing for a target and provide that pointing with a score relating to the degree of similarity between target and the reference stars. It does so by identifying potential points of aim for a particular telescope such that a given target and a varying set of references were included in a field of view centred on those pointings. A score is calculated for each such pointing. For each target, the pointing with the highest score is designated the optimum pointing. The application of this system to the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) catalogue demanded the use of a High Performance Computing (HPC) solution through Grid Ireland. Pointings have thus been generated for 61,662,376 stars and 23,697 quasars Although our imagination as policy-makers, legislators, academics, and members of the general public has been captured by the promise of fitness, what is meant by it and whether or not its individualising emphasis is a good thing is much less clear. In response to this question of cultural significance, this thesis provides a phenomenology of fitness. It does so in two important senses and in the context of two distinct parts.The first half of this thesis (Chapters One and Two) is given to the task of bracketing the natural attitude with respect to fitness; that is, contextualising the question of its cultural embeddedness within processes of reflexive embodiment that are at play in modern society. “Being fit,” it is argued in this context, implies “being fit for something” (something other than health) or “being fit for someone” (someone other than oneself). And, having lost some (if not all) of its modernist illusions and its progressivist convictions to social regeneration, the task of “being fit” is framed as an ambivalent one, akin to the modern-day Sisyphus, and gestural of the self-reflexivity inherent in late-modern consumer society.By shifting the organisation of attention from ambivalence, the second half ofthis thesis (Chapters Three and Four) examines the possibilities for a positive appropriation of fitness beyond mere consumption activity. By focusing on fitness at the level of action and interaction (where meaning relates to use and practice) the second half of this thesis opens up the possibilities for a re-description of fitness (of Sisyphus) on the basis of the following proposition: fitness is something we negotiate, despite it being something we never really achieve. Findings from twelve elaborative phenomenological interviews emanating from an ethnographic orientation over a two and a half year period are given towards this end. They indicate that this thesis (Chapters Three and Four) examines the possibilities for a positive appropriation of fitness beyond mere consumption activity. By focusing on fitness at the level of action and interaction (where meaning relates to use and practice) the second half of this thesis opens up the possibilities for a re-description of fitness (of Sisyphus) on the basis of the following proposition: fitness is something we negotiate, despite it being something we never really achieve. Findings from twelve elaborative phenomenological interviews emanating from an ethnographic orientation over a two and a half year period are given towards this end. They indicate that consigning fitness to mere consumption activity overlooks the importance of participants’ meaning-making activities, their motivations, and the pleasures that accrue on the basis of ongoing activity and increased experience. They indicate that, if “doing fitness” enables individuals to become acquainted with these internal goods, then “being someone through fitness” can operate as an indexical marker of virtue.The possibilities for a Complemental Model of Health and fitness and for a novel approach to talking about the fit body are discussed in conclusion (Chapter Five) and in the context of aligning the findings of this thesis to future research and practice Enzymes such as α-amylase and xylanase offer potential for numerous industrial applications such as food, beverage, and animal feed production, detergents, textile, cosmetics and biodiesel production. Economic factors such as achievement of optimum yields and production cost are the main deterrents in the industrial use of these enzymes. Enzymes are generally produced via microbial fermentation using expensive mediums which account for 30 to 40% of the production cost. Food industry wastes such as spent coffee waste (SCW) and Brewers’ spent grain (BSG) are two of the most common food waste products expelled by the food and beverage industry here in Ireland and are environmental burden. However, these inexpensive food wastes can be utilized as a substrate for the production of enzymes, which can significantly reduce the production cost of the enzymes and also enhance the value of underutilized food waste. Based on the above facts, the aim of this study is to exploit the lignocellulosic food industry waste such as BSG and SCW for the production of industrially viable enzymes such as α-amylase and xylanase. Although high in polysaccharide content, the effective utilisation of SCW and BSG requires specific pretreatment measures that result in a decrease in recalcitrance by removal of the lignin fraction. The aim of the project was achieved through the following objectives: ▪ Identification and development of the best pretreatment strategy for SCW and BSG that would enhance their enzymatic digestibility and liberation of higher amount of fermentable sugars. ▪ Optimisation of SCW and BSG for the production of enzymes such as α-amylase and xylanase. The effect of the pretreatments was primarily analysed as changes that occurred in the composition of SCW and BSG. A number of analytical techniques were used to characterise the pretreated waste samples, including FTIR, FESEM, XRD and DSC In recent years, Genetically Modified (GM) foods have become increasingly common on our supermarket shelves. Consumer concerns regarding their safety have prompted codes of practice and legislation requiring labelling of all GM-food-containing products. Labelling requires some means of verification. There is no simple means of detecting GM food and until recently, there were no tests available. The object of this study was to develop a simple, rapid and user-friendly method of detecting genetically modified foods. The study concentrated on the detection of GM tomatoes, using a commercially available tomato paste. The method of choice was the Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) targeting the selectable marker gene Neomycin Phosphotransferase II (NPTII). The selectable marker gene confers resistance to the antibiotic kanamycin, and is used to detect newly transformed plants in the laboratory. NPT II has commonly been used as a selectable marker and therefore can be used to test for many species of transgenic plants. A PCR method to detect NPT II was developed and applied to genetically modified tomato paste. Commonly used plant DNA extraction methods proved unsuitable and an extraction method based on microwave treatment of the paste was developed. This increased both the sensitivity and reproducibility of the PCR method. It was also attempted to develop a method to detect genetically modified soy using PCR, by targeting the cauliflower mosaic virus promoter gene In this thesis we consider the geometry of the Hilbert scheme of points in P^n, concentrating on the locus of points corresponding to the Gorenstein subschemes of P^n. New results are given, most importantly we provide tools for constructing flat families and analysis of finite Gorenstein algebras and expose their efficiency by proving smoothability of certain families of algebras. Much of the existing theory and folklore is reviewed, providing a micro-encyclopaedic reference.Comment: v2: some minor corrections made. 29 pages. This is an MSc thesis done   on the University of Warsaw; my adviser is Jaros{\l}aw Buczy\'nsk This research explored the acquisition of English by Programme Chechen refugees who arrived in Ireland ten years ago. Very many of them had less than a basic level of English. To meet the language needs of the newly arrived Chechen Programme refugees an intensive English course was set up by the local Vocational Education Committee. However, refugees’ basic needs such as health care, parental care took precedence over language provision. The research found that they were unable to fully participate in and benefit from the course. The process of acquiring English happened to a large extent outside the classroom. This research also looked at how the Chechens have acquired language outside the classroom and within their social environment since their initial English language course. The collective case study research with a qualitative approach produced a number of findings that complemented each other. The findings from the assessments, the questionnaire, the semi-structured interviews, individual case studies and notes made from empirical observation all reinforced each other. The experiences of the individual personalities which became apparent in the individual case studies also shared a lot in common. This research has shown that the Chechens in Roscommon town have become well integrated; they are independent and plan to stay. Most of them speak English quite well and are continuing to improve by participating in local society. Based on the results of this research, it is recommended that the initial language course for programme refugees should be set up at an appropriate time for them, after a period of time for settlement	['84231130', '84234435', '84229476', '84229466', '84228795', '128968618', '84231476', '17137770', '84232847']	[[{'name': 'Yang, Kansheng, [Thesis]'}], [{'name': 'McNamara, John, [Thesis]'}], [{'name': 'Finn, Donal, [Thesis]'}], [{'name': 'Creaner, Oisin, [Thesis]'}], [{'name': 'Neville, Ross, (Thesis)'}], [{'name': 'RAVINDRAN, RAJEEV, [Thesis]'}], [{'name': 'Boyce, Olivia, (Thesis)'}], [{'name': 'Adviser Jarosław Buczyński'}, {'name': 'Joachim Jelisiejew'}, {'name': 'Msc Thesis'}], [{'name': 'Rose, Liana, [Thesis]'}]]	['The Study of Reconfigurable Antennas and Associated Circuitry', 'The Effects of Intraspecific, interSpecific, and Intergeneric Grafting on the Growth and Development of Fraxinus Excelsior Scions', 'An Investigation into the Predictive Capability of Customer Spending in Modelling Mortgage Default', 'Data Mining by Grid Computing in the Search for Extrasolar Planets', 'A PHENOMENOLOGY OF FITNESS FROM CONSUMPTION TO VIRTUOUS PRODUCTION', 'Agro-industrial Lignocellulosic Biomass: A Sustainable Platform for the Production of α-amylase and xylanase A', 'Detection of Genetically Modified Foods', 'Deformations of zero-dimensional schemes and applications', 'English Language Acquisition by Chechen Programme Refugees in Roscommon, Ireland']	exploratory	9

Starting from an inhomogeneous cellular automata model of buyers dynamics, we show that when agents try to adjust their reservation price, the tatonement process does not converge to equilibrium at some intermediate market share and that large amplitude fluctuations are actually observed. When the tatonnement dynamics is slow with respect to the contagion dynamics, large periodic oscillations reminiscent of business cycles appear.Comment: 13 pages, 6 figure Two fundamental axioms in social choice theory are consistency with respect to a variable electorate and consistency with respect to components of similar alternatives. In the context of traditional non-probabilistic social choice, these axioms are incompatible with each other. We show that in the context of probabilistic social choice, these axioms uniquely characterize a function proposed by Fishburn (Rev. Econ. Stud., 51(4), 683--692, 1984). Fishburn's function returns so-called maximal lotteries, i.e., lotteries that correspond to optimal mixed strategies of the underlying plurality game. Maximal lotteries are guaranteed to exist due to von Neumann's Minimax Theorem, are almost always unique, and can be efficiently computed using linear programming The problem of merging several ontologies has important applications in the Semantic Web, medical ontology engineering           and other domains where information from several distinct sources needs to be integrated in a coherent manner.We propose           to view ontology merging as a problem of social choice, i.e. as a problem of aggregating the input of a set of individuals           into an adequate collective decision. That is, we propose to view ontology merging as ontology aggregation. As a first step in           this direction, we formulate several desirable properties for ontology aggregators, we identify the incompatibility of some of           these properties, and we define and analyse several simple aggregation procedures. Our approach is closely related to work           in judgment aggregation, but with the crucial difference that we adopt an open world assumption, by distinguishing between           facts not included in an agent’s ontology and facts explicitly negated in an agent’s ontology In democracies citizens are supposed to have some control over the general direction of policy. According to a pretheoretical interpretation of this idea, the people have control if elections and other democratic institutions compel officials to do what the people want, or what the majority want. This interpretation of popular control fits uncomfortably with insights from social choice theory; some commentators—Riker, most famously—have argued that these insights should make us abandon the idea of popular rule as traditionally understood. This article presents a formal theory of popular control that responds to the challenge from social choice theory. It makes precise a sense in which majorities may be said to have control even if the majority preference relation has an empty core. And it presents a simple game-theoretic model to illustrate how majorities can exercise control in this specified sense, even when incumbents are engaged in purely re-distributive policymaking and the majority rule core is empty In large scale collective decision making, social choice is a normative study of how one ought to design a protocol for reaching consensus. However, in instances where the underlying decision space is too large or complex for ordinal voting, standard voting methods of social choice may be impractical. How then can we design a mechanism - preferably decentralized, simple, scalable, and not requiring any special knowledge of the decision space - to reach consensus? We propose sequential deliberation as a natural solution to this problem. In this iterative method, successive pairs of agents bargain over the decision space using the previous decision as a disagreement alternative. We describe the general method and analyze the quality of its outcome when the space of preferences define a median graph. We show that sequential deliberation finds a 1.208- approximation to the optimal social cost on such graphs, coming very close to this value with only a small constant number of agents sampled from the population. We also show lower bounds on simpler classes of mechanisms to justify our design choices. We further show that sequential deliberation is ex-post Pareto efficient and has truthful reporting as an equilibrium of the induced extensive form game. We finally show that for general metric spaces, the second moment of of the distribution of social cost of the outcomes produced by sequential deliberation is also bounded Experiments can provide rich information on behavior conditional on the institutional rules of the game being imposed by the experimenter. We consider what happens when the subjects are allowed to choose the institution through a simple social choice procedure. Our case study is a setting in which sanctions may or may not be allowed to encourage "righteous behavior". Laboratory experiments show that some subjects in public goods environments employ costly sanctions against other subjects in order to enforce what appears to be a social norm of contribution. We show that this artificial society is not an attractive place to live, by any of the standard social choice criteria. If it came about because of evolutionary forces, as speculated, then The Blind Watchmaker was having one of his many bad days at the workbench. In fact, none of our laboratory societies with perfect strangers matching ever chose to live in such a world. Our findings suggest that the conditions under which a group or a society would choose a constitution that is based on voluntary costly sanctions are very special. We analyze single binary-choice voting rules and identify the presence of the No-Show paradox in this simple setting, as a consequence of specific turnout or quorum conditions that are included in actual rules. Since these conditions are meant to ensure a representative outcome, we formalize this concern and reach our main result: no voting rule can ensure representation if abstention is possible, unless restrictive assumptions are made on the preference domain of abstainers. We then focus on the main referendum systems and show that appropriate restrictions do make them compatible with representation. The main purpose of our paper is, however, to provide a tool for referendum design: rather than imposing arbitrary restrictions on the preference domain of non-voters, we recommend instead that a conscious choice be made on how abstention is to be interpreted and that this choice be used to derive the corresponding referendum rule..info:eu-repo/semantics/publishedVersio	['892081', '18049072', '8861692', '8858362', '44614654', '2544283', '144440084']	[[{'name': 'Albert'}, {'name': 'Dietrich Stauffer'}, {'name': 'Föllmer'}, {'name': 'Galam'}, {'name': 'Galam'}, {'name': 'Goldenberg'}, {'name': 'Gérard Weisbuch'}, {'name': 'Lesourne'}, {'name': 'Levy'}, {'name': 'Orléan'}, {'name': 'Plouraboué'}, {'name': 'Solomon'}, {'name': 'Vichniac'}, {'name': 'Watts'}, {'name': 'Weisbuch'}, {'name': 'Weisbuch'}, {'name': 'Weisbuch'}, {'name': 'Weisbuch'}], [{'name': 'Brandl, Florian'}, {'name': 'Brandt, Felix'}, {'name': 'Seedig, Hans Georg'}], [{'name': 'Endriss, Ulle'}, {'name': 'Porello, Daniele'}], [{'name': 'Ingham, Sean'}], [{'name': 'A Rubinstein'}, {'name': 'AE Roth'}, {'name': 'C Boutilier'}, {'name': 'D Saban'}, {'name': 'DE Knuth'}, {'name': 'DF Thompson'}, {'name': 'E Kalai'}, {'name': 'E Kalai'}, {'name': 'HJ Bandelt'}, {'name': 'J Fishkin'}, {'name': 'J Lang'}, {'name': 'J Schummer'}, {'name': 'JC Harsanyi'}, {'name': 'JF Nash'}, {'name': 'K Binmore'}, {'name': 'K Binmore'}, {'name': 'K Nehring'}, {'name': 'RB Myerson'}, {'name': 'RE Wendell'}, {'name': 'S Airiau'}, {'name': 'S Barbera'}, {'name': 'V Krishna'}], [{'name': 'Anabela Botelho'}, {'name': 'Elisabet E.

29481fe4-c6cc-4b1c-b913-7c6e50e7f82b	chagas	Background: The objective of this study is to report the costs of Chagas disease in Colombia, in terms of vector disease control programmes and the costs of providing care to chronic Chagas disease patients with cardiomyopathy. Methods: Data were collected from Colombia in 2004. A retrospective review of costs for vector control programmes carried out in rural areas included 3,084 houses surveyed for infestation with triatomine bugs and 3,305 houses sprayed with insecticide. A total of 63 patient records from 3 different hospitals were selected for a retrospective review of resource use. Consensus methodology with local experts was used to estimate care seeking behaviour and to complement observed data on utilisation. Findings: The mean cost per house per entomological survey was $4.4 (in US$ of 2004), whereas the mean cost of spraying a house with insecticide was $27. The main cost driver of spraying was the price of the insecticide, which varied greatly. Treatment of a chronic Chagas disease patient costs between $46.4 and $7,981 per year in Colombia, depending on severity and the level of care used. Combining cost and utilisation estimates the expected cost of treatment per patient-year is $1,028, whereas lifetime costs averaged $11,619 per patient. Chronic Chagas disease patients have limited access to healthcare, with an estimated 22% of patients never seeking care. Conclusion: Chagas disease is a preventable condition that affects mostly poor populations living in rural areas. The mean costs of surveying houses for infestation and spraying infested houses were low in comparison to other studies and in line with treatment costs. Care seeking behaviour and the type of insurance affiliation seem to play a role in the facilities and type of care that patients use, thus raising concerns about equitable access to care. Preventing Chagas disease in Colombia would be cost-effective and could contribute to prevent inequalities in health and healthcare.Wellcome Trus Chagas disease or American trypanosomiasis is, together with geohelminths, the neglected disease that causes more loss of years of healthy life due to disability in Latin America. Chagas disease, as determined by the factors and determinants, shows that different contexts require different actions, preventing new cases or reducing the burden of disease. Control strategies must combine two general courses of action including prevention of transmission to prevent the occurrence of new cases (these measures are cost effective), as well as opportune diagnosis and treatment of infected individuals in order to prevent the clinical evolution of the disease and to allow them to recuperate their health. All actions should be implemented as fully as possible and with an integrated way, to maximise the impact. Chagas disease cannot be eradicated due because of the demonstrated existence of infected wild triatomines in permanent contact with domestic cycles and it contributes to the occurrence of at least few new cases. However, it is possible to interrupt the transmission of Trypanosoma cruzi in a large territory and to eliminate Chagas disease as a public health problem with a dramatic reduction of burden of the disease.Fil: Sosa-Estani, Sergio Alejandro.

Administración Nacional de Laboratorio e Instituto de Salud. Instituto Nacional de Parasitología; Argentina. Consejo Nacional de Investigaciones Científicas y Técnicas; Argentin PurposeWe have established a prospective cohort of 1959 patients with chronic Chagas cardiomyopathy to evaluate if a clinical prediction rule based on ECG, brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) levels, and other biomarkers can be useful in clinical practice. This paper outlines the study and baseline characteristics of the participants.ParticipantsThe study is being conducted in 21 municipalities of the northern part of Minas Gerais State in Brazil, and includes a follow-up of 2 years. The baseline evaluation included collection of sociodemographic information, social determinants of health, health-related behaviours, comorbidities, medicines in use, history of previous treatment for Chagas disease, functional class, quality of life, blood sample collection, and ECG. Patients were mostly female, aged 50-74 years, with low family income and educational level, with known Chagas disease for &gt;10 years; 46% presented with functional class &gt;II. Previous use of benznidazole was reported by 25.2% and permanent use of pacemaker by 6.2%. Almost half of the patients presented with high blood cholesterol and hypertension, and one-third of them had diabetes mellitus. N-terminal of the prohormone BNP (NT-ProBNP) level was &gt;300 pg/mL in 30% of the sample.Findings to dateClinical and laboratory markers predictive of severe and progressive Chagas disease were identified as high NT-ProBNP levels, as well as symptoms of advanced heart failure. These results confirm the important residual morbidity of Chagas disease in the remote areas, thus supporting political decisions that should prioritise in addition to epidemiological surveillance the medical treatment of chronic Chagas cardiomyopathy in the coming years. The São Paulo-Minas Gerais Tropical Medicine Research Center (SaMi-Trop) represents a major challenge for focused research in neglected diseases, with knowledge that can be applied in primary healthcare.Future plansWe will continue following this patients' cohort to provide relevant information about the development and progression of Chagas disease in remotes areas, with social and economic inequalities.Trial registration numberNCT02646943; Pre-results Trypanosoma cruzi infection is often not detected early on or actively diagnosed, partly because most infected individuals are either asymptomatic or oligosymptomatic. Moreover, in most places, neither blood banks nor healthcare units offer diagnostic confirmation or treatment access. By the time patients present clinical manifestations of advanced chronic Chagas disease, specific treatment with current drugs usually has limited effectiveness. Better-quality serological assays are urgently needed, especially rapid diagnostic tests for diagnosis patients in both acute and chronic phases, as well as for confirming that a parasitological cure has been achieved. Some new antigen combinations look promising and it is important to assess which ones are potentially the best, together with their requirements in terms of investigation and development. In August 2007, a group of specialized researchers and healthcare professionals met to discuss the state of Chagas infection diagnosis and to build a consensus for a plan of action to develop efficient, affordable, accessible and easy-to-use diagnostic tests for Chagas disease. This technical report presents the conclusions from that meeting BackgroundCruzain, the major cysteine protease of Trypanosoma cruzi, is an essential enzyme for the parasite life cycle and has been validated as a viable target to treat Chagas' disease. As a proof-of-concept, K11777, a potent inhibitor of cruzain, was found to effectively eliminate T. cruzi infection and is currently a clinical candidate for treatment of Chagas' disease.Methodology/principal findingsWRR-483, an analog of K11777, was synthesized and evaluated as an inhibitor of cruzain and against T. cruzi proliferation in cell culture. This compound demonstrates good potency against cruzain with sensitivity to pH conditions and high efficacy in the cell culture assay. Furthermore, WRR-483 also eradicates parasite infection in a mouse model of acute Chagas' disease. To determine the atomic-level details of the inhibitor interacting with cruzain, a 1.5 A crystal structure of the protease in complex with WRR-483 was solved. The structure illustrates that WRR-483 binds covalently to the active site cysteine of the protease in a similar manner as other vinyl sulfone-based inhibitors. Details of the critical interactions within the specificity binding pocket are also reported.ConclusionsWe demonstrate that WRR-483 is an effective cysteine protease inhibitor with trypanocidal activity in cell culture and animal model with comparable efficacy to K11777. Crystallographic evidence confirms that the mode of action is by targeting the active site of cruzain. Taken together, these results suggest that WRR-483 has potential to be developed as a treatment for Chagas' disease Introduction:Chagas disease, caused by the parasite Trypanosoma cruzi, can lead to long term cardiac morbidity. Treatment of children with benznidazole is effective, but no pediatric pharmacokinetics data are available and clinical pharmacology information on the drug is scarce.Patients and Methods:Prospective population pharmacokinetic (PK) cohort study in children 2-12 years old with Chagas disease treated with oral benznidazole 5-8 mg/kg/day BID for 60 days. (clinicaltrials.gov #NCT00699387).Results:Forty children were enrolled in the study. Mean age was 7.3 years. A total of 117 samples were obtained from 38 patients for PK analysis. A one compartment model best fit the data. Weight-corrected clearance rate (CL/F) showed a good correlation with age, with younger patients having a significantly higher CL/F than older children and adults. Simulated median steady-state benznidazole concentrations, based on model parameters, were lower for children in our study than for adults and lowest for children under 7 years of age. Treatment was efficacious in the 37 patients who completed the treatment course, and well tolerated, with few, and mild, adverse drug reactions (ADRs).Discussion:Observed benznidazole plasma concentrations in children were markedly lower than those previously reported in adults (treated with comparable mg/kg doses), possibly due to a higher CL/F in smaller children. These lower blood concentrations were nevertheless associated to a high therapeutic response in our cohort. Unlike adults, children have few adverse reactions to the drug, suggesting that there may be a direct correlation between drug concentrations and incidence of ADRs. Our results suggest that studies with lower doses in adults may be warranted.Trial Registration:ClinicalTrails.gov NCT00699387.Fil: Altcheh, Jaime Marcelo.

We use EPPA to assess the human health damages (including acute mortality and morbidity outcomes) caused by ozone pollution and quantify their economic impacts in sixteen world regions. We compare the costs of ozone pollution under scenarios with 2000 and 2050 ozone precursor and greenhouse gas emissions (SRES A1B scenario). We estimate that health costs due to global ozone pollution above pre-industrial levels by 2050 will be $580 billion (year 2000$) and that acute mortalities will exceed 2 million. We find that previous methodologies underestimate costs of air pollution by more than a third because they do not take into account the long-term, compounding effects of health costs. The economic effects of emissions changes far exceed the influence of climate alone.United States Department of Energy, Office of Science (BER) grants DE-FG02-94ER61937 and DE-FG02-93ER61677, the United States Environmental Protection Agency grant EPA-XA-83344601-0, and the industrial and foundation sponsors of the MIT Joint Program on the Science and Policy of Global Change We examine O3 production and its sensitivity to precursor gases and boundary layer mixing in Korea by using a 3-D global chemistry transport model and extensive observations during the KORea-US cooperative Air Quality field study in Korea, which occurred in May–June 2016. During the campaign, observed aromatic species onboard the NASA DC-8 aircraft, especially toluene, showed high mixing ratios of up to 10 ppbv, emphasizing the importance of aromatic chemistry in O3 production. To examine the role of VOCs and NOx in O3 chemistry, we first implement a detailed aromatic chemistry scheme in the model, which reduces the normalized mean bias of simulated O3 mixing ratios from –26% to –13%. Aromatic chemistry also increases the average net O3 production in Korea by 37%. Corrections of daytime PBL heights, which are overestimated in the model compared to lidar observations, increase the net O3 production rate by ~10%. In addition, increasing NOx emissions by 50% in the model shows best performance in reproducing O3 production characteristics, which implies that NOx emissions are underestimated in the current emissions inventory. Sensitivity tests show that a 30% decrease in anthropogenic NOx emissions in Korea increases the O3 production efficiency throughout the country, making rural regions ~2 times more efficient in producing O3 per NOx consumed. Simulated O3 levels overall decrease in the peninsula except for urban and other industrial areas, with the largest increase (~6 ppbv) in the Seoul Metropolitan Area (SMA). However, with simultaneous reductions in both NOx and VOCs emissions by 30%, O3 decreases in most of the country, including the SMA. This implies the importance of concurrent emission reductions for both NOx and VOCs in order to effectively reduce O3 levels in Korea	['2104621', '78115563']	[[{'name': ''}, {'name': 'Bell M L'}, {'name': 'Bickel P'}, {'name': 'Center for International Earth Science Information Network (CIESIN)'}, {'name': 'Ebi K L'}, {'name': 'Heston A Summers R Aten B'}, {'name': 'Holland M'}, {'name': 'Holland M'}, {'name': 'J M Reilly'}, {'name': 'K M Nam'}, {'name': 'Knowlton K'}, {'name': 'M D Webster'}, {'name': 'Matus K'}, {'name': 'Mayeres I'}, {'name': 'Mickley L J'}, {'name': 'N E Selin'}, {'name': 'Nam K-M Selin N E Reilly J M Paltsev S'}, {'name': 'Paltsev S Reilly J M Jacoby H D Eckaus R S McFarland J Sarofim M Asadoorian M Babiker M'}, {'name': 'R G Prinn'}, {'name': 'Royal Society'}, {'name': 'S Paltsev'}, {'name': 'S Wu'}, {'name': 'United Nations'}, {'name': 'Webster M Paltsev S Parsons J Reilly J Jacoby H'}], [{'name': 'Blake, Donald R'}, {'name': 'Brune, William H'}, {'name': 'Crawford, James H'}, {'name': 'Fried, Alan'}, {'name': 'Kim, Sang-Woo'}, {'name': 'Oak, Yujin J'}, {'name': 'Park, Rokjin J'}, {'name': 'Schroeder, Jason R'}, {'name': 'Weinheimer, Andrew J'}, {'name': 'Wisthaler, Armin'}, {'name': 'Woo, Jung-Hun'}, {'name': 'Yeo, Huidong'}]]	['Global Health and Economic Impacts of Future Ozone Pollution', 'Evaluation of simulated O-3 production efficiency during the KORUS-AQ campaign: Implications for anthropogenic NOx emissions in Korea']	navigational	2
520291f8-dd22-4191-a24e-c860174d8d25	wagner anti-terrorism	The outcome of the Civil War brought freedom to over six million slaves of African descent. These Freedmen communities remained a critical source of labor for the agrarian based economy of the southern U.S. Conflicts erupted because former slaves sought to exercise their new freedoms against the restrictions placed on them by local authorities. New laws, mob actions and acts of organized white terrorism were used to subjugate free citizens and return them to their former stations of labor. Political activities and participation in the electoral process were violently discouraged. Vocal opponents of the new system were often targeted for murder along with their families. A vital component to this oppressive movement was a concerted effort among local southern governments to disarm African American citizens. Radical Republicans attempted to intercede with new laws based on 2nd amendment protections, but Northern indifference to the plight of former slaves made this politically futile. Unconstitutional firearm restrictions in the reconstruction south ensured that the subjugation of Freedmen would continue indefinitely. Without political agency, or the means of an organized community militia to generate such power, the realization of freedom and the rights of citizenship for African Americans remained unobtainable for nearly 100 years This paper seeks to analyse cultural trauma theories and their consequences as well as their potential applicability to cases of collective trauma where access to the legal arena in the rehabilitation process is not possible. When ‘state terror’ occurs, such as in Latin America, or, more arguably Italy, access to the legal arena is systematically denied through a variety of criminal strategies. In these cases, the cultural working through of trauma takes place on the aesthetic level. What are the consequences of this process both for the inscription of the crucial event in public discourse and for its relationship with justice? Moreover, how do aesthetic codes affect the public definition of justice and a collective understanding of what happened?Publisher PD New security threats have emerged as major new areas of policy development in the European Union, especially during the 'war on terror'. This paper makes two significant points that counter theoretical expectations of EU counter-terrorism. Both are derived from an analysis of empirical events of EU practice. Firstly, it argues that it is vital to analyse EU institutional actor behaviour in the process of 'constructing security threats', especially when dealing with the responses to international terrorism. Secondly, despite the importance of member states in the European Union, institutional actors such as the European Commission or the Council Secretariat are increasingly gaining in importance. The Commission can (though not always does) play a significant role in this process - the role of a supranational policy entrepreneur. Yet, it is not alone in this - the Council Secretariat can also add to the notion of policy entrepreneurship at the EU level. This argument reveals shortcomings of intergovernmental understanding of European integration in the area of counter-terrorism. The paper analyses different dimensions of EU counter-terrorism, its legal and political construction, and demonstrates the significance of supranational policy entrepreneurs in the political adoption process When you hear the word “terrorist,” who do you picture? Chances are, it is not a white person. In the United States, two common though false narratives about terrorists who attack America abound. We see them on television, in the movies, on the news, and, currently, in the Trump administration. The first is that “terrorists are always (brown) Muslims.” The second is that “white people are never terrorists.” Different strands of critical race theory can help us understand these two narratives. One strand examines the role of unconscious cognitive biases in the production of stereotypes, such as the stereotype of the “Muslim terrorist.” Another strand focuses on white privilege, such as the privilege of avoiding the terrorist label. These false narratives play a crucial role in Trump’s propaganda. As the critical race analysis uncovers, these two narratives dovetail with two constituent parts of propaganda: flawed ideologies and aspirational myths. Propaganda relies on preexisting false ideologies, which is another way to describe racist stereotyping. Propaganda also relies on certain ideals and myths, in this case, the myth of white innocence and white superiority. Thus, the Trump administration’s intentional invocation of both narratives amounts to propaganda in more than just the colloquial sense. Part I illustrates each of the two narratives. Part II then analyzes them through a critical race lens, showing how they map onto two strands of critical race theory. Next, Part III examines how these narratives simultaneously enable and constitute propaganda. Finally, Part IV argues that the propagation of these false narratives hurts the nation’s security The passage of the Wagner (National Labor Relations) Act of 1935 represented an unprecedented effort to guarantee American workers basic labor rights--the rights to organize unions, to provoke meaningful collective bargaining, and to strike. Previous attempts by workers and government administrators to realize these rights in the workplace met with extraordinary, often violent, resistance from powerful industrial employers, whose repressive measures were described by government officials as a system of  industrial terrorism.  Although labor scholars have acknowledged these practices and paid some attention to the way they initially frustrated labor rights and influenced the jurisprudence and politics of labor relations in the late 1930s and early 1940s, the literature has neither adequately described the extent and intensity of this phenomenon nor fully explored its effects. This Article remedies that shortcoming. Focusing on three industries where the practice of industrial terrorism was especially well developed and its influence especially pronounced, this Article shows how the practitioners of industrial terrorism and their allies in Congress were able to turn the legacy of violence and disorder, which they authored by their violent resistance to the Wagner Act, into the basis of an extraordinary counterattack on labor rights. It shows how this attack culminated in 1947 with the enactment of the profoundly reactionary Taft-Hartley Act and remade the landscape of American labor relations @ 2012 by the Regents of the University of California. All rights reserved.The article analyzes prohibitions on membership in terrorist organizations and examines their justifiability. It begins by providing a definition of a terrorist organization. It then describes the far-reaching modern prohibitions on membership in terrorist organizations in various jurisdictions. The article goes on to provide a doctrinal analysis of membership offenses. Based on similarities with conspiracy doctrine, membership offenses are analyzed as expansions of attempt law or, in some cases, of complicity doctrines. The justfiability of this expansion is examined. The article introduces a distinction between exclusively terrorist organizations, passive membership of which can be legitimately prohibited under certain conditions, and ancillary and dual-purpose organizations, passive membership of which cannot be legitimately prohibited. Next, the justiflability ofprohibiting more active forms of membership in each of these types of organizations is discussed. Last, guidelines for the legislation of appropriate prohibitions are proposed Both crime and terrorism impose costs onto society through the channels of fear and worry. Identifying and targeting groups which are especially affected by worries might be one way to reduce the total costs of these two types of insecurity. However, compared to the drivers of the fear of crime, the determinants of concerns regarding global terrorism are less well known.

The Centre for Elder Research is working with Sheridan faculty member Dr. Kirsten Madsen and Elder Abuse Prevention (ON) to better understand bullying between older adults age 55+ in Ontario. This work is funded by the Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada and aims to support the development of best practices and strategies for this diverse population. Our project aims are to collect data on the prevalence and nature of Senior to Senior bullying in Ontario, and to use this data to create a resource package outlining best practices for seniors and those working with seniors to stop bullying Research on bullying and victimization largely rests on univariate analyses and on reports from a single informant. Researchers may thus know too little about the simultaneous effects of various independent and dependent variables, and their research may be biased by shared method variance. The database for this Dutch study was large (N = 1,065) and rich enough to allow multivariate analysis and multisource information. In addition, the effect of familial vulnerability for internalizing and externalizing disorders was studied. Gender, aggressiveness, isolation, and dislikability were most strongly related to bullying and victimization. Among the many findings that deviated from or enhanced the univariate knowledge base were that not only victims and bully/victims but bullies as well were disliked and that parenting was unrelated to bullying and victimization once other factors were controlled. Improvements in anti-bullying strategies are likely to depend upon a greater understanding of the psychological processes at work. Transactional theories of coping may be appropriate models to use when examining how the victims of bullying cope with victimization. Research has started to examine the coping strategy aspects of such theories but has neglected the process of appraisal. The current paper aims to address this by examining the perceptions of control in the victims of bullying, and how these are influenced by such variables as gender and the severity, persistence and type of bullying experienced. A self-report questionnaire examining coping responses and perceptions of control regarding the bullying situation was administered to 348 children aged nine to 11 years. Data from the victims of bullying (N = 184) revealed that girls felt less in control of frequent bullying than infrequent bullying, a trend not evident in boys (p < 0.05). In addition, a significantly higher proportion of the male victims of bullying felt more in control than female victims (p < 0.01). Finally, victims of short-term bullying were significantly more likely to feel in control than were victims of longer-term bullying (p < 0.05). The complex relationship between gender, perceptions of control, and the persistence and frequency of bullying has implications for early intervention and for professionals working with the victims of bullying	['9558348', '5467275', '4189764']	[[{'name': 'Bullying Project, Seniors'}], [{'name': 'Lindenberg, Siegwalt'}, {'name': 'Oldehinkel, Albertine J.'}, {'name': 'Ormel, Johan'}, {'name': 'Veenstra, René'}, {'name': 'Verhulst, Frank C.'}, {'name': 'Winter, Andrea F. de'}], [{'name': 'Boyle, J.'}, {'name': 'Hunter, Simon C.'}]]	['Overall Summary of Ontario-wide ThinkTanks', 'Bullying and Victimization in Elementary Schools: A Comparison of Bullies, Victims, Bully/Victims, and Uninvolved Preadolescents', 'Perceptions of control in the victims of school bullying : the importance of early intervention']	navigational	3
5e287983-19c4-496c-9c2d-b5366b8e1383	visual fields	In order to determine whether or not facial attractiveness plays a role in hemispheric facial memory, 35 right-handed participants first assigned attractiveness ratings to faces and then performed a recognition test on those faces in the left visual half-field (LVF) and right visual half-field (RVF). We found significant interactions between the experimental factors and visual half- field. There were significant differences in the extreme ends of the rating scale, that is, the very unattractive versus the very attractive faces: Female participants remembered very attractive faces of both women and men, with memory being superior in the RVF than in the LVF. In contrast, the male participants remembered very unattractive faces of both women and men; RVF memory was better than the LVF for women faces while for men faces memory was superior in the LVF. The interactions with visual half-field suggest that hemispheric biases in remembering faces are influenced by degree of attractiveness The visual fields of Aegypiinae vultures have been shown to be adapted primarily to  meet two key perceptual challenges of their obligate carrion-feeding behaviour: scanning the ground and preventing the sun’s image falling upon the retina. However, field observations have shown that foraging White-headed Vultures (Trigonoceps occipitalis) are not exclusively carrion-feeders; they are also facultative predators of live prey. Such feeding is likely to present perceptual challenges that are additional to those posed by carrion-feeding. Binocularity is the key component of all visual fields and in birds it is thought to function primarily in the accurate placement and time of contact of the talons and bill, especially in the location and seizure of food items. We determined visual fields in White-headed Vultures and two species of carrion-eating Gyps vultures, and show that the visual field of White-headed Vultures have more similarities with those of predatory raptors (e.g. Accipitrid hawks), compared with the taxonomically more closely related Gyps vultures. We found that maximum binocular field width in White-headed vultures (30°) is significantly wider than Gyps vultures (20°). The broader binocular fields in White-headed Vultures probably facilitate accurate placement and timing of the talons when capturing evasive live prey AbstractIt has been proposed that elementary arithmetic induces spatial shifts of attention. However, the timing of this arithmetic-space association remains unknown. Here we investigate this issue with a target detection paradigm. Detecting targets in the right visual field was faster than in the left visual field when preceded by an addition operation, while detecting targets in the left visual field was faster than in the right visual field when preceded by a subtraction operation. The arithmetic-space association was found both at the end of the arithmetic operation and during calculation. In contrast, the processing of operators themselves did not induce spatial biases. Our results suggest that the arithmetic-space association resides in the mental arithmetic operation rather than in the individual numbers or the operators. Moreover, the temporal course of this effect was different in addition and subtraction.</jats:p Objective: To explore the effect of visual field loss on the daily life of community-dwelling stroke survivors.  Design: A qualitative interview study.  Participants: Adult stroke survivors with visual field loss of at least six months’ duration.  Methods: Semi-structured interviews were conducted with a non-purposive sample of 12 stroke survivors in their own homes. These were recorded, transcribed verbatim and analyzed with the framework method, using an inductive approach.  Results: Two key analytical themes emerged. ‘Perception, experience and knowledge’ describes participant’s conflicted experience of having knowledge of their impaired vision but lacking perception of that visual field loss and operating under the assumption that they were viewing an intact visual scene when engaged in activities. Inability to recognize and deal with visual difficulties, and experiencing the consequences, contributed to their fear and loss of self-confidence. ‘Avoidance and adaptation’ were two typologies of participant response to visual field loss. Initially, all participants consciously avoided activities. Some later adapted to vision loss using self-directed head and eye scanning techniques.  Conclusions: Visual field loss has a marked impact on stroke survivors. Stroke survivors lack perception of their visual loss in everyday life, resulting in fear and loss of confidence. Activity avoidance is a common response, but in some, it is replaced by self-initiated adaptive techniques Introduction. Macular degeneration (MD) causes central visual field loss. When field defects occur in both eyes and overlap, parts of the visual pathways are no longer stimulated. Previous reports have shown that this affects the grey matter of the primary visual cortex, but possible effects on the preceding visual pathway structures have not been fully established. Method. In this multicentre study, we used high-resolution anatomical magnetic resonance imaging and voxel-based morphometry to investigate the visual pathway structures up to the primary visual cortex of patients with age-related macular degeneration (AMD) and juvenile macular degeneration (JMD). Results. Compared to age-matched healthy controls, in patients with JMD we found volumetric reductions in the optic nerves, the chiasm, the lateral geniculate bodies, the optic radiations and the visual cortex. In patients with AMD we found volumetric reductions in the lateral geniculate bodies, the optic radiations and the visual cortex. An unexpected finding was that AMD, but not JMD, was associated with a reduction in frontal white matter volume. Conclusion. MD is associated with degeneration of structures along the visual pathways. A reduction in frontal white matter volume only present in the AMD patients may constitute a neural correlate of previously reported association between AMD and mild cognitive impairment.   Keywords: macular degeneration - visual pathway - visual field - voxel-based morphometryComment: appears in Cortex (2013 Speech is inherently multisensory, containing auditory information from the voice and visual information from the mouth movements of the talker. Hearing the voice is usually sufficient to understand speech, however in noisy environments or when audition is impaired due to aging or disabilities, seeing mouth movements greatly improves speech perception. Although behavioral studies have well established this perceptual benefit, it is still not clear how the brain processes visual information from mouth movements to improve speech perception. To clarify this issue, I studied the neural activity recorded from the brain surfaces of human subjects using intracranial electrodes, a technique known as electrocorticography (ECoG). First, I studied responses to noisy speech in the auditory cortex, specifically in the superior temporal gyrus (STG). Previous studies identified the anterior parts of the STG as unisensory, responding only to auditory stimulus. On the other hand, posterior parts of the STG are known to be multisensory, responding to both auditory and visual stimuli, which makes it a key region for audiovisual speech perception. I examined how these different parts of the STG respond to clear versus noisy speech. I found that noisy speech decreased the amplitude and increased the across-trial variability of the response in the anterior STG. However, possibly due to its multisensory composition, posterior STG was not as sensitive to auditory noise as the anterior STG and responded similarly to clear and noisy speech. I also found that these two response patterns in the STG were separated by a sharp boundary demarcated by the posterior-most portion of the Heschl’s gyrus. Second, I studied responses to silent speech in the visual cortex. Previous studies demonstrated that visual cortex shows response enhancement when the auditory component of speech is noisy or absent, however it was not clear which regions of the visual cortex specifically show this response enhancement and whether this response enhancement is a result of top-down modulation from a higher region. To test this, I first mapped the receptive fields of different regions in the visual cortex and then measured their responses to visual (silent) and audiovisual speech stimuli. I found that visual regions that have central receptive fields show greater response enhancement to visual speech, possibly because these regions receive more visual information from mouth movements. I found similar response enhancement to visual speech in frontal cortex, specifically in the inferior frontal gyrus, premotor and dorsolateral prefrontal cortices, which have been implicated in speech reading in previous studies. I showed that these frontal regions display strong functional connectivity with visual regions that have central receptive fields during speech perception Inhibition of return (IOR) as an indicator of attentional control is characterized by an eccentricity effect, that is, the more peripheral visual field shows a stronger IOR magnitude relative to the perifoveal visual field. However, it could be argued that this eccentricity effect may not be an attention effect, but due to cortical magnification. To test this possibility, we examined this eccentricity effect in two conditions: the same-size condition in which identical stimuli were used at different eccentricities, and the size-scaling condition in which stimuli were scaled according to the cortical magnification factor (M-scaling), thus stimuli being larger at the more peripheral locations. The results showed that the magnitude of IOR was significantly stronger in the peripheral relative to the perifoveal visual field, and this eccentricity effect was independent of the manipulation of stimulus size (same-size or size-scaling). These results suggest a robust eccentricity effect of IOR which cannot be eliminated by M-scaling. Underlying neural mechanisms of the eccentricity effect of IOR are discussed with respect to both cortical and subcortical structures mediating attentional control in the perifoveal and peripheral visual field The ability to detect sudden changes in the environment is important for survival. However, studies of “change blindness” have shown that image differences are hard to detect when a time delay or a mask is imposed between the different images.  However, when sensory adaptation is permitted by accuratefixation, we find that change detection is not only possible but asymmetrical: a single changed target amongst 15 unchanging distractors is much easier to detect than a target defined by its lack of change. Although adaptation may selectively reduce the apparent contrast of unchanged objects, the asymmetry in “change salience” cannot be attributed to any such reduction because genuine reductions in target contrast increase, rather than decrease, target detectability. Analogous results preclude attribution to apparent differences between a) target onset and distractor onset and b) their temporal frequencies (both flickered at 7.5 Hz, minimizing afterimages).  Our results demonstrate a hitherto underappreciated (or unappreciated) advantage conferred by low-level sensory adaptation: it automatically elevates the salience of previously absent objects Barn owls hunt in the dark by using cues from both sight and sound to locate their prey. This task is facilitated by topographic maps of the external space formed by neurons (e.g., in the optic tectum) that respond to visual or aural signals from a specific direction. Plasticity of these maps has been studied in owls forced to wear prismatic spectacles that shift their visual field. Adaptive behavior in young owls is accompanied by a compensating shift in the response of (mapped) neurons to auditory signals. We model the receptive fields of such neurons by linear filters that sample correlated audio-visual signals, and search for filters that maximize the gathered information, while subject to the costs of rewiring neurons. Assuming a higher fidelity of visual information, we find that the corresponding receptive fields are robust and unchanged by artificial shifts. The shape of the aural receptive field, however, is controlled by correlations between sight and sound. In response to prismatic glasses, the aural receptive fields shift in the compensating direction, although their shape is modified due to the costs of rewiring.Comment: 7 pages, 1 figur Non-arteritic posterior ischemic optic neuropathy (NA-PION) is a disorder of reduced blood flow to the retrobulbar optic nerve. There is usually an acute loss of visual acuity and field.  Previous studies have noted an improvement in visual acuity and in ocular and retrobulbar blood flow with the use of a potent vasodilator of the microcirculation, prostaglandin E1 (PGE1), and steroids. The current report describes immediate improvement in the visual fields  and visual acuity in a patient with NA-PION treated with intravenous PGE1 and steroids 66 hours after onset. An 89-year-old white female was first seen in December 2016 with a sudden loss of vision in the right eye. After a complete eye exam and visual fields, the patient was diagnosed with NA-PION. Treatment was immediately started with steroids and intravenous PGE1. This was repeated once again the next morning. Visual acuity in the right eye improved from 1/10 + 1 to 7/10 + 3 at 5 days. The mean deviation of the visual field improved from – 7.10 decibels (dB) with a central scotoma of – 22 dB to – 2.97 dB with a central scotoma of – 19 dB.  After 2 weeks, her visual acuity was 7/10 + 1 and visual field testing of the right eye revealed a mean deviation of – 2.54 dB with a central scotoma of – 9 dB. The left eye was unchanged. In cases of NA-PION, PGE1 and steroids should be considered to immediately restore blood flow to help improve visual acuity and visual fields PurposeTo examine the prevalence of visual field deterioration in contralateral eyes of patients with worsening open-angle glaucoma and to evaluate the spatial concordance of visual field deterioration between both eyes.MethodsOne hundred sixteen open-angle glaucoma patients who underwent 8 or more visual field examinations over ≥ 6 years of follow-up were included. The rates of the fast and slow components of visual field decay for each of 52 visual field test locations were calculated with point-wise exponential regression analysis. The spatial concordance of visual field deterioration in contralateral eyes was evaluated with a concordance ratio (calculated as the number of overlapping locations divided by the total number of deteriorating locations) and by comparing the rate of decay in corresponding modified glaucoma hemifield test clusters.ResultsThe average visual field mean deviation (± standard deviation [SD]) was -8.5 (± 6.4) dB and the mean (± SD) follow-up time was 9.0 (± 1.6) years. Sixty-three patients had mild damage, 23 had moderate damage, and 30 had severe damage. The mean concordance ratio (± SD) was 0.46 (± 0.32) for the mild group, 0.33 (± 0.27) for the moderate group, and 0.35 (± 0.21) for the severe group. Thirty-one patients (27%) had deterioration in concordant locations (p &lt; 0.05). Visual field deterioration was greater in the superior hemifield than the inferior hemifield (p &lt; 0.05) when evaluated with both the concordance ratio and modified glaucoma hemifield test cluster analysis methods.ConclusionsThere is only fair spatial concordance with regard to visual field deterioration between the both eyes of an individual. We conclude that testing algorithms taking advantage of inter-eye spatial concordance would not be particularly advantageous in the early detection of glaucomatous deterioration Receptive field profiles registered by cell recordings have shown that mammalian vision has developed receptive fields tuned to different sizes and orientations in the image domain as well as to different image velocities in space-time. This article presents a theoretical model by which families of idealized receptive field profiles can be derived mathematically from a small set of basic assumptions that correspond to structural properties of the environment. The article also presents a theory for how basic invariance properties to variations in scale, viewing direction and relative motion can be obtained from the output of such receptive fields, using complementary selection mechanisms that operate over the output of families of receptive fields tuned to different parameters. Thereby, the theory shows how basic invariance properties of a visual system can be obtained already at the level of receptive fields, and we can explain the different shapes of receptive field profiles found in biological vision from a requirement that the visual system should be invariant to the natural types of image transformations that occur in its environment.Comment: 40 pages, 17 figure Background: Visual impairment affects up to 70% of stroke survivors. We designed an app (StrokeVision) to facilitate screening for common post stroke visual issues (acuity, visual fields and visual inattention). We sought to describe the test-time, feasibility, acceptability and accuracy of our app based digital visual assessments against a) current methods used for bedside screening, and b) gold standard measures.    Methods: Patients were prospectively recruited from acute stroke settings. Index tests were app based assessments of fields and inattention performed by a trained researcher. We compared against usual clinical screening practice of visual fields to confrontation including inattention assessment (simultaneous stimuli). We also compared app to gold standard assessments of formal kinetic perimetry (Goldman or Octopus Visual Field Assessment); and pencil and paper based tests of inattention (Albert’s, Star Cancellation, and Line Bisection). Results of inattention and field tests were adjudicated by a specialist Neuro-Ophthalmologist. All assessors were masked to each other’s results. Participants and assessors graded acceptability using a bespoke scale that ranged from 0 (completely unacceptable) to 10 (perfect acceptability).    Results: Of 48 stroke survivors recruited, the complete battery of index and reference tests for fields was successfully completed in 45. Similar acceptability scores were observed for app-based (assessor median score 10 [IQR:9-10]; patient 9 [IQR:8-10]) and traditional bedside testing (assessor 10 [IQR:9-10; patient 10 [IQR:9-10]). Median test time was longer for app-based testing (combined time-to-completion of all digital tests 420 seconds [IQR:390-588]) when compared with conventional bedside testing (70 seconds, [IQR:40-70]) but shorter than gold standard testing (1260 seconds, [IQR:1005-1620]). Compared with gold standard assessments, usual screening practice demonstrated 79% sensitivity and 82% specificity for detection of a stroke-related field defect. This compares with 79% sensitivity and 88% specificity for StrokeVision digital assessment.     Conclusion: StrokeVision shows promise as a screening tool for visual complications in the acute phase of stroke. The app is at least as good as usual screening and offers other functionality that may make it attractive for use in acute stroke	['259516', '8257516', '42934098', '8752701', '18040348', '40106278', '5234827', '8015515', '1122536', '46688686', '85867587', '17012721', '49541131']	[[{'name': 'Deblieck, Choi'}, {'name': 'Zaidel, Dahlia W.'}], [{'name': 'Fowler'}, {'name': 'Griffiths'}, {'name': 'Guillemain'}, {'name': 'Kane'}, {'name': 'Martin'}, {'name': 'Martin'}, {'name': 'Martin'}, {'name': 'Martin'}, {'name': 'Martin'}, {'name': 'Martin'}, {'name': 'Martin'}, {'name': 'Martin'}, {'name': 'Martin'}, {'name': 'Mundy'}, {'name': 'Mundy'}, {'name': 'Murn'}, {'name': "O'Rourke"}, {'name': 'Potier'}], [{'name': 'Cai, Danni'}, {'name': 'Chen, Qi'}, {'name': 'Liu, Dixiu'}, {'name': 'Verguts, Tom'}], [{'name': 'Alex Pollock'}, {'name': 'Anne Taylor'}, {'name': 'Biddle L.'}, {'name': 'Bowling A.'}, {'name': 'Bridget Davis'}, {'name': 'Christine Hazelton'}, {'name': 'Critchley M.'}, {'name': 'Glyn Walsh'}, {'name': 'Harrington DO.'}, {'name': 'Hayes A'}, {'name': 'Heilman K'}, {'name': 'Macnee CL'}, {'name': 'Marian C Brady'}, {'name': 'Pollock A'}, {'name': 'Ritchie J'}, {'name': 'Ritchie J'}, {'name': 'Robson C.'}, {'name': 'Rubin HJ'}, {'name': 'Van Lew S'}], [{'name': 'Baseler, Heidi A.'}, {'name': 'Cornelissen, Frans W.'}, {'name': 'Gouws, Andre'}, {'name': 'Greenlee, Mark W.'}, {'name': 'Hernowo, Aditya T.'}, {'name': 'Hooymans, Johanna M.

63e0bfcc-cdad-46cb-a54c-e2344624501a	cell therapy	A summit on cellular therapy for cancer discussed and presented advances related to the use of adoptive cellular therapy for melanoma and other cancers. The summit revealed that this field is advancing rapidly. Conventional cellular therapies, such as tumor infiltrating lymphocytes (TIL), are becoming more effective and more available. Gene therapy is becoming an important tool in adoptive cell therapy. Lymphocytes are being engineered to express high affinity T cell receptors (TCRs), chimeric antibody-T cell receptors (CARs) and cytokines. T cell subsets with more naïve and stem cell-like characteristics have been shown in pre-clinical models to be more effective than unselected populations and it is now possible to reprogram T cells and to produce T cells with stem cell characteristics. In the future, combinations of adoptive transfer of T cells and specific vaccination against the cognate antigen can be envisaged to further enhance the effectiveness of these therapies Β-blockers (BB) are a primary treatment for chronic heart disease (CHD), resulting in prognostic and symptomatic benefits. Cardiac cell therapy represents a promising regenerative treatment and, for autologous cell therapy, the patients clinical history may correlate with the biology of resident progenitors and the quality of the final cell product. This study aimed at uncovering correlations between clinical records of biopsy-donor CHD patients undergoing cardiac surgery and the corresponding yield and phenotype of cardiospheres (CSs) and CS-derived cells (CDCs), which are a clinically relevant population for cell therapy, containing progenitors. We describe a statistically significant association between BB therapy and improved CSs yield and CDCs phenotype. We show that BB-CDCs have a reduced fibrotic-like CD90 + subpopulation, with reduced expression of collagen-I and increased expression of cardiac genes, compared to CDCs from non-BB donors. Moreover BB-CDCs had a distinctive microRNA expression profile, consistent with reduced fibrotic features (miR-21, miR-29a/b/c downregulation), and enhanced regenerative potential (miR-1, miR-133, miR-101 upregulation) compared to non-BB. In vitro adrenergic pharmacological treatments confirmed cytoprotective and anti-fibrotic effects of β1-blocker on CDCs. This study shows anti-fibrotic and pro-commitment effects of BB treatment on endogenous cardiac reparative cells, and suggests adjuvant roles of β-blockers in cell therapy applications The cellular and molecular mechanisms of tumor angiogenesis and its prospects for anti-angiogenic cancer therapy are major issues in almost all current concepts of both cancer biology and targeted cancer therapy. Currently, (1) sprouting angiogenesis, (2) vascular co-option, (3) vascular intussusception, (4) vasculogenic mimicry, (5) bone marrow-derived vasculogenesis, (6) cancer stem-like cell-derived vasculogenesis and (7) myeloid cell-driven angiogenesis are all considered to contribute to tumor angiogenesis. Many of these processes have been described in developmental angiogenesis; however, the relative contribution and relevance of these in human brain cancer remain unclear. Preclinical tumor models support a role for sprouting angiogenesis, vascular co-option and myeloid cell-derived angiogenesis in glioma vascularization, whereas a role for the other four mechanisms remains controversial and rather enigmatic. The anti-angiogenesis drug Avastin (Bevacizumab), which targets VEGF, has become one of the most popular cancer drugs in the world. Anti-angiogenic therapy may lead to vascular normalization and as such facilitate conventional cytotoxic chemotherapy. However, preclinical and clinical studies suggest that anti-VEGF therapy using bevacizumab may also lead to a pro-migratory phenotype in therapy resistant glioblastomas and thus actively promote tumor invasion and recurrent tumor growth. This review focusses on (1) mechanisms of tumor angiogenesis in human malignant glioma that are of particular relevance for targeted therapy and (2) controversial issues in tumor angiogenesis such as cancer stem-like cell-derived vasculogenesis and bone-marrow-derived vasculogenesis Controversy exists regarding the potential regenerative influences of incretin therapy on pancreatic β-cells versus possible adverse pancreatic proliferative effects. Examination of pancreata from age-matched organ donors with type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM) treated by incretin therapy (n = 8) or other therapy (n = 12) and nondiabetic control subjects (n = 14) reveals an ∼40% increased pancreatic mass in DM treated with incretin therapy, with both increased exocrine cell proliferation (P &lt; 0.0001) and dysplasia (increased pancreatic intraepithelial neoplasia, P &lt; 0.01). Pancreata in DM treated with incretin therapy were notable for α-cell hyperplasia and glucagon-expressing microadenomas (3 of 8) and a neuroendocrine tumor. β-Cell mass was reduced by ∼60% in those with DM, yet a sixfold increase was observed in incretin-treated subjects, although DM persisted. Endocrine cells costaining for insulin and glucagon were increased in DM compared with non-DM control subjects (P &lt; 0.05) and markedly further increased by incretin therapy (P &lt; 0.05). In conclusion, incretin therapy in humans resulted in a marked expansion of the exocrine and endocrine pancreatic compartments, the former being accompanied by increased proliferation and dysplasia and the latter by α-cell hyperplasia with the potential for evolution into neuroendocrine tumors Background:Due to significant limitations to the access to orthotropic liver transplantation, cell therapies forliver diseases have gained large interest worldwide.Scope of review:To revise current literature dealing with cell therapy for liver diseases. We discussed the ad-vantages and pitfalls of the different cell sources tested so far in clinical trials and the rationale underlying thepotential benefits of transplantation of human biliary tree stem cells (hBTSCs).Major conclusions:Transplantation of adult hepatocytes showed transient benefits but requires immune-sup-pression that is a major pitfall in patients with advanced liver diseases. Mesenchymal stem cells and hemato-poietic stem cells transplanted into patients with liver diseases are not able to replace resident hepatocytes butrather they target autoimmune or inflammatory processes into the liver. Stem cells isolated from fetal or adultliver have been recently proposed as alternative cell sources for advanced liver cirrhosis and metabolic liverdisease. We demonstrated the presence of multipotent cells expressing a variety of endodermal stem cell markersin (peri)-biliary glands of bile ducts in fetal or adult human tissues, and in crypts of gallbladder epithelium. Inthefirst cirrhotic patients treated in our center with biliary tree stem cell therapy, we registered no adverse eventbut significant benefits.General significance:The biliary tree stem cell could represent the ideal cell source for the cell therapy of liverdiseases. This article is part of a Special Issue entitled: Cholangiocytes in Health and Diseaseedited by JesusBanales, Marco Marzioni, Nicholas LaRusso and Peter Jansen BACKGROUND    Used in combination with antiretroviral therapy, subcutaneous recombinant interleukin-2 raises CD4+ cell counts more than does antiretroviral therapy alone. The clinical implication of these increases is not known.    METHODS    We conducted two trials: the Subcutaneous Recombinant, Human Interleukin-2 in HIV-Infected Patients with Low CD4+ Counts under Active Antiretroviral Therapy (SILCAAT) study and the Evaluation of Subcutaneous Proleukin in a Randomized International Trial (ESPRIT). In each, patients infected with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) who had CD4+ cell counts of either 50 to 299 per cubic millimeter (SILCAAT) or 300 or more per cubic millimeter (ESPRIT) were randomly assigned to receive interleukin-2 plus antiretroviral therapy or antiretroviral therapy alone. The interleukin-2 regimen consisted of cycles of 5 consecutive days each, administered at 8-week intervals. The SILCAAT study involved six cycles and a dose of 4.5 million IU of interleukin-2 twice daily; ESPRIT involved three cycles and a dose of 7.5 million IU twice daily. Additional cycles were recommended to maintain the CD4+ cell count above predefined target levels. The primary end point of both studies was opportunistic disease or death from any cause.    RESULTS    In the SILCAAT study, 1695 patients (849 receiving interleukin-2 plus antiretroviral therapy and 846 receiving antiretroviral therapy alone) who had a median CD4+ cell count of 202 cells per cubic millimeter were enrolled; in ESPRIT, 4111 patients (2071 receiving interleukin-2 plus antiretroviral therapy and 2040 receiving antiretroviral therapy alone) who had a median CD4+ cell count of 457 cells per cubic millimeter were enrolled. Over a median follow-up period of 7 to 8 years, the CD4+ cell count was higher in the interleukin-2 group than in the group receiving antiretroviral therapy alone--by 53 and 159 cells per cubic millimeter, on average, in the SILCAAT study and ESPRIT, respectively. Hazard ratios for opportunistic disease or death from any cause with interleukin-2 plus antiretroviral therapy (vs. antiretroviral therapy alone) were 0.91 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.70 to 1.18; P=0.47) in the SILCAAT study and 0.94 (95% CI, 0.75 to 1.16; P=0.55) in ESPRIT. The hazard ratios for death from any cause and for grade 4 clinical events were 1.06 (P=0.73) and 1.10 (P=0.35), respectively, in the SILCAAT study and 0.90 (P=0.42) and 1.23 (P=0.003), respectively, in ESPRIT.    CONCLUSIONS    Despite a substantial and sustained increase in the CD4+ cell count, as compared with antiretroviral therapy alone, interleukin-2 plus antiretroviral therapy yielded no clinical benefit in either study. (ClinicalTrials.gov numbers, NCT00004978 [ESPRIT] and NCT00013611 [SILCAAT study]. Cell therapy has been intensely studied for over a decade as a potential treatment for ischaemic heart disease. While initial trials using skeletal myoblasts, bone marrow cells and peripheral blood stem cells showed promise in improving cardiac function, benefits were found to be short-lived likely related to limited survival and engraftment of the delivered cells. The discovery of putative cardiac 'progenitor' cells as well as the creation of induced pluripotent stem cells has led to the delivery of cells potentially capable of electromechanical integration into existing tissue. An alternative strategy involving either direct reprogramming of endogenous cardiac fibroblasts or stimulation of resident cardiomyocytes to regenerate new myocytes can potentially overcome the limitations of exogenous cell delivery. Complimentary approaches utilizing combination cell therapy and bioengineering techniques may be necessary to provide the proper milieu for clinically significant regeneration. Clinical trials employing bone marrow cells, mesenchymal stem cells and cardiac progenitor cells have demonstrated safety of catheter based cell delivery, with suggestion of limited improvement in ventricular function and reduction in infarct size. Ongoing trials are investigating potential benefits to outcome such as morbidity and mortality. These and future trials will clarify the optimal cell types and delivery conditions for therapeutic effect Acknowledgements The work described in this review was supported by a grant from the MRC.

The impact extended to their social life and ability to form close relationships, and has implications for holistic practice. Presented at Association for European Paediatric Cardiology conference in Munich The medical field is creating large amount of data that physicians are unable to decipher and use efficiently. Moreover, rule-based expert systems are inefficient in solving complicated medical tasks or for creating insights using big data. Deep learning has emerged as a more accurate and effective technology in a wide range of medical problems such as diagnosis, prediction and intervention. Deep learning is a representation learning method that consists of layers that transform the data non-linearly, thus, revealing hierarchical relationships and structures. In this review we survey deep learning application papers that use structured data, signal and imaging modalities from cardiology. We discuss the advantages and limitations of applying deep learning in cardiology that also apply in medicine in general, while proposing certain directions as the most viable for clinical use.Comment: 27 pages, 2 figures, 10 table For patients admitted with worsening heart failure, early follow-up after discharge is recommended. Whether outcomes can be improved when follow-up is done by cardiologists is uncertain. We aimed to determine the association between cardiology follow-up and risk of death for patients with heart failure discharged from hospital. Using data from the National Heart Failure Audit (England &amp; Wales), we investigated the effect of referral to cardiology follow-up on 30-day and one-year mortality in 68 772 patients with heart failure and a reduced left ventricular ejection fraction (HFREF) discharged from 185 hospitals between 2007 to 2013. The primary analyses used instrumental variable analysis complemented by hierarchical logistic and propensity matched models. At the hospital level, rates of referral to cardiologists varied from 6% to 96%. The median odds ratio (OR) for referral to cardiologist was 2.3 (95% confidence interval [CI] 2.1, 2.5), suggesting that, on average, the odds of a patient being referred for cardiologist follow-up after discharge differed approximately 2.3 times from one randomly selected hospital to another one. Based on the proportion of patients (per region) referred for cardiology follow-up, referral for cardiology follow-up was associated with lower 30-day (OR 0.70; CI 0.55, 0.89) and one-year mortality (OR 0.81; CI 0.68, 0.95) compared with no plans for cardiology follow-up (i.e., standard follow-up done by family doctors). Results from hierarchical logistic models and propensity matched models were consistent (30-day mortality OR 0.66; CI 0.61, 0.72 and 0.66; CI 0.58, 0.76 for hierarchical and propensity matched models, respectively). For patients with HFREF admitted to hospital with worsening symptoms, referral to cardiology services for follow-up after discharge is strongly associated with reduced mortality, both early and late 博士(医学) 甲第690号(主論文の要旨、要約、審査結果の要旨、本文)，著者名:Umiko ISHIZAKI・Michinobu NAGANO・Yumi SHIINA・Kei INAI・Hiroki MORI・Tatsunori TAKAHASHI・Shuji SAKAI，タイトル:Global strain and dyssynchrony of the single ventricle predict adverse cardiac events after the Fontan procedure: Analysis using feature-tracking cine magnetic resonance imaging，掲載誌:Journal of cardiology(0914-5087)，巻・頁・年:73巻2号 p.163-170(2019)，著作権関連情報:© 2018 Japanese College of Cardiology.

The objective of this study was to report the creation of metrics for patients with Kawasaki disease. Over a period of 5 months, 12 pediatric cardiologists developed 24 quality metrics based on the most relevant statements, guidelines, and research studies pertaining to Kawasaki disease. Of the 24 metrics, the 8 metrics deemed the most important, feasible, and valid were sent on to the ACPC for consideration. Seven of the 8 metrics were approved using the RAND method by an expert panel. All 7 metrics approved by the ACPC council were accepted by ACPC membership after an "open comments" process.

6a5812ec-7505-4110-91c6-2046711ef0f5	study of language in the philippines	The issue of classroom language anxiety, considered a significant factor that hinders language learning, has received an increasing amount of research in the field of language education. In the Philippines, despite the abundance of literature regarding students\u27 language anxiety, the shift in the learning environment due to the pandemic may have significantly affected the language anxiety experienced by learners. Hence, this study sought to investigate students\u27 language and computer-mediated communication (CMC) anxieties as they communicate through technology during online classes. Subsequently, it was aimed at identifying the relationship between language anxiety and CMC anxiety. Employing Krashen\u27s Theory of Affective Filter (1982) and Brown et al.’s computer-mediated communication anxiety theory (2004), this paper utilized adapted questionnaires from Jugo\u27s (2020) English Language Anxiety Scale and Brown et al.’s (2004) CMC Anxiety Scale to measure the students\u27 language and CMC anxieties, respectively. A total of 377 undergraduate students from the Faculty of Arts and Letters in a Philippine university participated in this study. Findings revealed that students have a generally low level of language anxiety. Nevertheless, the respondents are inclined to encounter unease when participating in speaking exercises. It was also found that they have low CMC anxiety and look forward to using computers to communicate. This study underscores that language anxiety and CMC anxiety correlate. Hence, the study reveals that students with higher language anxiety tend to engage less in computer-mediated communication and participate less in online classrooms. The results provide important information about university students\u27 language and CMC anxieties during online classes in the Philippines, which may serve as a lens to assess and adjust the strategies and approaches of instructors with the hope of diminishing or eliminating the said anxieties in digital classrooms experienced by learners in the country In the wake of an exponential increase in English speakers around the globe, code-switching stands as a multidisciplinary field of investigation that elucidates the global spectrum of English varieties. Code-switching is an irrevocable and integral element of everyday communication in the Philippines. A comprehensive sociolinguistic discourse analysis of code-switching in Philippine English contributes to the understanding of language development in the Philippines, how language mixing manifests in the discursive practices of post-colonial English environments, and how new Englishes are born from the necessity to communicate in ethnographically diverse contexts.  This study endeavors to explore this phenomenon by analyzing instances of code-switching within the Philippine English section of the International Corpus of Englishes (ICE-PHI). By applying discourse analysis research approaches, this dissertation examines the prevalence of first language (L1) lexical borrowing in various contexts, identifies emergent semantic categories inherent within the lexical items, and describes the sociolinguistic functions of these items through a systematic interpretive research model grounded in social constructivism (Vygotsky, 1978).  The results of this study are discussed within the context of previous literature and exemplify how the data recovered help address the paucity of research on sociolinguistic functions of codeswitching. By analyzing the ICE-PHI for emergent semantic codes, this study provides evidence that further substantiates assertions regarding the utility of code-switching as it pertains to facilitating sociolinguistic functions and communicative efficiency. This essay concludes with future potential research directions, limitations of the study, and pedagogical implications derived from the research findings As one of the official languages of the Philippines, English predominantly figures in thedomains of education, government, and the judiciary. This reality has always put English at the top of the linguistic ladder, relegating local languages to lower ranks. This scenario appears to be evident also in the domain of the church. In this paper, I investigate signs posted within the compound of a major Catholic church located in the Philippines in terms of types and language use. Informed by linguistic landscape concepts pioneered by Landry and Bourhis (1997), Spolsky and Cooper (1991), and Ben-Rafael (2009), I analyzed over a hundred signs in the religious linguistic landscape, which I call ‘churchscape’. Findings show that English dominates in the churchscape as a language of communication and language of tourism while local languages such as Filipino and Pangasinan assume a secondary role in the churchscape. This study affords us an interesting view and alternative understanding of multilingualism as a phenomenon through the churchscape in question	['154035039', '157344265', '126916110']	[[{'name': 'Ballesteros-Lintao, Rachelle'}, {'name': 'Forro, Marikah Devon'}], [{'name': 'Waber, Zachary'}], [{'name': 'Esteron, Jerico Juan'}]]	['Investigating College Students’ Second Language and Computer-Mediated Communication Anxieties in a Philippine Comprehensive University', 'Sociolinguistic functions of L1 in Philippine English: a corpus analysis', 'ENGLISH IN THE CHURCHSCAPE: EXPLORING A RELIGIOUS LINGUISTIC LANDSCAPE IN THE PHILIPPINES']	navigational	3
70c12149-1b19-483d-96e1-f46010bc35f1	fascin	Glomerular hypertension causes glomerulosclerosis via the loss of podocytes, which are challenged by increased mechanical load. We have demonstrated that podocytes are mechanosensitive. However, the response of podocytes to mechanical stretching remains incompletely understood. Here we demonstrate that the actin-bundling protein fascin-1 plays an important role in podocytes that are exposed to mechanical stress. Immunofluorescence staining revealed colocalization of fascin-1 and nephrin in mouse kidney sections. In cultured mouse podocytes fascin-1 was localized along actin fibers and filopodia in stretched and unstretched podocytes. The mRNA and protein levels of fascin-1 were not affected by mechanical stress. By Western blot and 2D-gelelectrophoresis we observed that phospho-fascin-1 was significantly downregulated after mechanical stretching. It is known that phosphorylation at serine 39 (S39) regulates the bundling activity of fascin-1, e.g. required for filopodia formation. Podocytes expressing wild type GFP-fascin-1 and non-phosphorylatable GFP-fascin-1-S39A showed marked filopodia formation, being absent in podocytes expressing phosphomimetic GFP-fascin-1-S39D. Finally, the immunofluorescence signal of phosphorylated fascin-1 was strongly reduced in glomeruli of patients with diabetic nephropathy compared to healthy controls. In summary, mechanical stress dephosphorylates fascin-1 in podocytes in vitro and in vivo thereby fascin-1 may play an important role in the adaptation of podocytes to mechanical forces We examine the mechanism of bundling of cytoskeletal actin filaments by two representative bundling proteins, fascin and espin. Small-angle X-ray studies show that increased binding from linkers drives a systematic \textit{overtwist} of actin filaments from their native state, which occurs in a linker-dependent fashion. Fascin bundles actin into a continuous spectrum of intermediate twist states, while espin only allows for untwisted actin filaments and fully-overtwisted bundles. Based on a coarse-grained, statistical model of protein binding, we show that the interplay between binding geometry and the intrinsic \textit{flexibility} of linkers mediates cooperative binding in the bundle. We attribute the respective continuous/discontinous bundling mechanisms of fascin/espin to differences in the stiffness of linker bonds themselves.Comment: 5 pages, 3 figures, figure file has been corrected in v Fascin is an actin-binding and bundling protein that is highly upregulated in most epithelial cancers. Fascin promotes cell migration and adhesion dynamics in vitro and tumour cell metastasis in vivo. However, potential non-actin bundling roles for fascin remain unknown. Here we show for the first time that fascin can directly interact with the microtubule cytoskeleton and that this does not depend upon fascin-actin bundling. Microtubule binding contributes to fascin-dependent control of focal adhesion dynamics and cell migration speed. We also show that fascin forms a complex with focal adhesion kinase (FAK) and Src, and that this signalling pathway lies downstream of fascin-microtubule association in the control of adhesion stability. These findings shed light on new non actin-dependent roles for fascin and may have implications for the design of therapies to target fascin in metastatic disease The delta-retrovirus Human T-cell leukemia virus type 1 (HTLV-1) preferentially infects CD4(+) T-cells via cell-to-cell transmission. Viruses are transmitted by polarized budding and by transfer of viral biofilms at the virological synapse (VS). Formation of the VS requires the viral Tax protein and polarization of the host cytoskeleton, however, molecular mechanisms of HTLV-1 cell-to-cell transmission remain incompletely understood. Recently, we could show Tax-dependent upregulation of the actin-bundling protein Fascin (FSCN-1) in HTLV-1-infected T-cells. Here, we report that Fascin contributes to HTLV-1 transmission. Using single-cycle replication-dependent HTLV-1 reporter vectors, we found that repression of endogenous Fascin by short hairpin RNAs and by Fascin-specific nanobodies impaired gag p19 release and cell-to-cell transmission in 293T cells. In Jurkat T-cells, Tax-induced Fascin expression enhanced virus release and Fascin-dependently augmented cell-to-cell transmission to Raji/CD4(+) B-cells. Repression of Fascin in HTLV-1-infected T-cells diminished virus release and gag p19 transfer to co-cultured T-cells. Spotting the mechanism, flow cytometry and automatic image analysis showed that Tax-induced T-cell conjugate formation occurred Fascin-independently. However, adhesion of HTLV-1-infected MT-2 cells in co-culture with Jurkat T-cells was reduced upon knockdown of Fascin, suggesting that Fascin contributes to dissemination of infected T-cells. Imaging of chronically infected MS9 T-cells in co-culture with Jurkat T-cells revealed that Fascin's localization at tight cell-cell contacts is accompanied by gag polarization suggesting that Fascin directly affects the distribution of gag to budding sites, and therefore, indirectly viral transmission. In detail, we found gag clusters that are interspersed with Fascin clusters, suggesting that Fascin makes room for gag in viral biofilms. Moreover, we observed short, Fascin-containing membrane extensions surrounding gag clusters and clutching uninfected T-cells. Finally, we detected Fascin and gag in long-distance cellular protrusions. Taken together, we show for the first time that HTLV-1 usurps the host cell factor Fascin to foster virus release and cell-to-cell transmission Fascin, an actin-bundling protein involved in cell motility, has been shown to be upregulated in several types of carcinomas. In this study, we investigated the expression of fascin in 228 advanced colonic adenocarcinoma patients with a long follow-up. Fascin expression was compared with several clinicopathologic parameters and survival. Overall, fascin immunoreactivity was detected in 162 (71%) tumours with a prevalence for right-sided tumours (P<0.001). Fascin correlated significantly with sex, tumour grade and stage, mucinous differentiation, number of metastatic lymph nodes, extranodal tumour extension, and the occurrence of distant metastases. Patients with fascin-expressing tumours experienced a shorter disease-free and overall survival in comparison with those with negative tumours, and fascin immunoreactivity emerged as an independent prognostic factor in the multivariate analysis. Moreover, patients with the same tumour stages could be stratified in different risk categories for relapse and progression according to fascin expression. Our findings suggest that fascin is a useful prognostic marker for colonic adenocarcinomas Background & AimsPancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is often lethal because it is highly invasive and metastasizes rapidly. The actin-bundling protein fascin has been identified as a biomarker of invasive and advanced PDAC and regulates cell migration and invasion in vitro. We investigated fascin expression and its role in PDAC progression in mice.MethodsWe used KRasG12D p53R172H Pdx1-Cre (KPC) mice to investigate the effects of fascin deficiency on development of pancreatic intraepithelial neoplasia (PanIn), PDAC, and metastasis. We measured levels of fascin in PDAC cell lines and 122 human resected PDAC samples, along with normal ductal and acinar tissues; we associated levels with patient outcomes.ResultsPancreatic ducts and acini from control mice and early-stage PanINs from KPC mice were negative for fascin, but approximately 6% of PanIN3 and 100% of PDAC expressed fascin. Fascin-deficient KRasG12D p53R172H Pdx1-Cre mice had longer survival times, delayed onset of PDAC, and a lower PDAC tumor burdens than KPC mice; loss of fascin did not affect invasion of PDAC into bowel or peritoneum in mice. Levels of slug and fascin correlated in PDAC cells; slug was found to regulate transcription of Fascin along with the epithelial−mesenchymal transition. In PDAC cell lines and cells from mice, fascin concentrated in filopodia and was required for their assembly and turnover. Fascin promoted intercalation of filopodia into mesothelial cell layers and cell invasion. Nearly all human PDAC samples expressed fascin, and higher fascin histoscores correlated with poor outcomes, vascular invasion, and time to recurrence.ConclusionsThe actin-bundling protein fascin is regulated by slug and involved in late-stage PanIN and PDAC formation in mice. Fascin appears to promote formation of filopodia and invasive activities of PDAC cells. Its levels in human PDAC correlate with outcomes and time to recurrence, indicating it might be a marker or therapeutic target for pancreatic cancer Fascin is an actin binding and bundling protein that is not expressed in normal epithelial tissues but overexpressed in a variety of invasive epithelial tumors. It has a critical role in cancer cell metastasis by promoting cell migration and invasion. Here we report the crystal structures of fascin in complex with a series of novel and potent inhibitors. Structure-based elaboration of these compounds enabled the development of a series with nanomolar affinities for fascin, good physicochemical properties and the ability to inhibit fascin-mediated bundling of filamentous actin. These compounds provide promising starting points for fascin-targeted anti-metastatic therapies Fascins, a family of actin-bundling proteins, are expressed in a spatially and temporally restricted manner during development and often in cancer. Fascin 1 has a clear role in cell migration in vitro, but its role in vivo in mammals is not well understood. Here, we investigate the role of fascin 1 in the melanocyte lineage and in melanoma cells. Fascin 1 knockout causes hypopigmentation in adult mice owing to migration and cell cycle progression defects in melanoblasts, the melanocyte precursor cell. Study of live embryo skin explants reveals that E14.5 fascin 1-null melanoblasts migrate slower, and generate fewer and thinner pseudopods. By contrast, fascin 1 expression drives faster migration and lamellipodia protrusion in melanocytes in vitro. In addition, fascin 1 depletion retards melanoblast proliferation in vivo and melanoma cell growth in vitro. These data indicate that fascin 1 not only promotes cell migration in mouse melanocytes but it also has a role in growth and cell cycle progression Invasion and metastasis are major reason for poor prognosis of digestive system carcinoma patients. Motility and migratory capacity are important in contributing to tumor cells’ invasion and metastasis. Fascin is one of actin cross-linking proteins and can participate in forming parallel actin bundles in cell protrusions. Fascin-1 is consequently involved in cell adhesion, motility, and signaling. In cultured cells, over-expression of fascin-1 can increase migration and invasion capacity of cells. Many studies show up-expressions of fascin-1 are significantly associated with worse prognosis, poor differentiation, TNM stage, positive for lymph node metastasis, and positive for distant metastasis in digestive system carcinoma patients. So fascin-1 may have prognostic value as an early biomarker for more aggressive digestive system carcinoma. This review provides detailed account of preclinical studies conducted to determine the utility of fascin-1 as a therapeutic and predictive agent in invasion and metastasis of carcinomas	['85597153', '671223', '8221601', '42935166', '3545181', '42383242', '54966699', '6811365', '10694623']	[[{'name': 'Amann, Kerstin'}, {'name': 'Cohen, Clemens D.'}, {'name': 'Darm, Katrin'}, {'name': 'Endlich, Karlhans'}, {'name': 'Endlich, Nicole'}, {'name': 'Kliewe, Felix'}, {'name': 'Lindenmeyer, Maja T.'}, {'name': 'Rogge, Henrik'}, {'name': 'Scharf, Christian'}], [{'name': 'B.

7f8c3877-24ee-4c27-9500-2b43a6ae3aad	530 fisica	It is widely accepted that strong and variable radiation detected over all accessible energy bands in a number of active galaxies arises from a relativistic, Doppler-boosted jet pointing close to our line of sight. The size of the emitting zone and the location of this region relative to the central supermassive black hole are, however, poorly known, with estimates ranging from light-hours to a light-year or more. Here we report the coincidence of a gamma-ray flare with a dramatic change of optical polarization angle. This provides evidence for co-spatiality of optical and gamma-ray emission regions and indicates a highly ordered jet magnetic field. The results also require a non-axisymmetric structure of the emission zone, implying a curved trajectory for the emitting material within the jet, with the dissipation region located at a considerable distance from the black hole, at about 10^5 gravitational radii.Comment: Published in Nature issued on 18 February 2010. Corresponding   authors: Masaaki Hayashida and Greg Madejsk We present the results of the BeppoSAX observations of two BL Lacs, OQ 530 and S5 0716+714, as part of a ToO program for the simultaneous observation at radio, optical, X-ray and TeV energies. Both sources are detected in the LECS and MECS, with S5 0716+714 visible also in the PDS band, up to about 60 keV. The X-ray spectra of both sources are better fitted by a double power-law model, with a steep soft X-ray component flattening at harder energies, with breaks at 0.3 and 1.5 keV, respectively. The concave shape of the spectra in both objects is consistent with soft X-rays being produced by the synchrotron and harder X-rays by the inverse Compton processes. Also the X-ray variability properties confirm this scenario, in particular for S5 0716+714 our observation shows variations by about a factor 3 over one hour below 3 keV and no variability above. Their simultaneous broad band energy spectral distributions can be successfully interpreted within the frame of a homogeneous synchrotron and inverse Compton model, including a possible contribution from an external source of seed photons with the different spectral states of S5 0716+714 being reproduced by changing the injected power. The resulting parameters are fully consistent with the two sources being intermediate objects within the "sequence" scenario proposed for blazars.Comment: 10 pages, 8 figures, accepted by A& The CUORICINO experiment was an array of 62 TeO$_{2}$ single-crystal bolometers with a total $^{130}$Te mass of $11.3\,$kg. The experiment finished in 2008 after more than 3 years of active operating time. Searches for both $0\nu$ and $2\nu$ double-beta decay to the first excited $0^{+}$ state in $^{130}$Xe were performed by studying different coincidence scenarios. The analysis was based on data representing a total exposure of N($^{130}$Te)$\cdot$t=$9.5\times10^{25}\,$y. No evidence for a signal was found. The resulting lower limits on the half lives are $T^{2\nu}_{1/2}(^{130} Te\rightarrow^{130} Xe^{*})>1.3\times10^{23}\,$y (90% C.L.), and $T^{0\nu}_{1/2}(^{130} Te\rightarrow^{130} Xe^{*})>9.4\times10^{23}\,$y (90% C.L.).Comment: 6 pages, 4 figure A formalism is presented to evaluate the Sivers function in constituent quark models. A non-relativistic reduction of the scheme is performed and applied to the Isgur-Karl model. The sign for the $u$ and $d$ flavor contributions that we obtained turns out to be opposite. The Burkardt Sum Rule is fulfilled to a large extent. After the estimate of the QCD evolution of the results from the momentum scale of the model to the experimental one, a reasonable agreement with the available data is obtained.Comment: To appear in the proceedings of Diffraction 2008: International   Workshop On Diffraction In High Energy Physics, 9-14 Sep 2008, La   Londe-les-Maures, France.

85ff8569-f95c-4935-8998-8dddf623b290	taiwan	Magnetowave induced plasma wakefield acceleration (MPWA) in a relativistic astrophysical outflow has been proposed as a viable mechanism for the acceleration of cosmic particles to ultra high energies. Here we present simulation results that clearly demonstrate the viability of this mechanism for the first time. We invoke the high frequency and high speed whistler mode for the driving pulse. The plasma wakefield so induced validates precisely the theoretical prediction. We show that under appropriate conditions, the plasma wakefield maintains very high coherence and can sustain high-gradient acceleration over a macroscopic distance. Invoking gamma ray burst (GRB) as the source, we show that MPWA production of ultra high energy cosmic rays (UHECR) beyond ZeV 10^21 eV is possible.Comment: 4 pages, 4 figure There are two very different interpretations of the prehistory of Island Southeast Asia (ISEA), with genetic evidence invoked in support of both. The “out-of-Taiwan” model proposes a major Late Holocene expansion of Neolithic Austronesian speakers from Taiwan. An alternative, proposing that Late Glacial/postglacial sea-level rises triggered largely autochthonous dispersals, accounts for some otherwise enigmatic genetic patterns, but fails to explain the Austronesian language dispersal. Combining mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA), Y-chromosome and genome-wide data, we performed the most comprehensive analysis of the region to date, obtaining highly consistent results across all three systems and allowing us to reconcile the models. We infer a primarily common ancestry for Taiwan/ISEA populations established before the Neolithic, but also detected clear signals of two minor Late Holocene migrations, probably representing Neolithic input from both Mainland Southeast Asia and South China, via Taiwan. This latter may therefore have mediated the Austronesian language dispersal, implying small-scale migration and language shift rather than large-scale expansion This study presents the perceived and projected image of Taiwan as a travel destination from perspectives from Mainland China. The perceived image of Taiwan was examined by interviewing 28 Mainland Chinese; the projected image of Taiwan was investigated by analyzing articles in China's most popular travel magazines. The different types of images of Taiwan among visitors, nonvisitors, and travel magazines were compared. The projected image changed notably after the opening of Taiwan's tourism to travelers from Mainland China. The results of this study could help destination marketing organizations to assess their marketing strategies for the Mainland Chinese travel market There has been a long-standing debate concerning the extent to which the spread of Neolithic ceramics and Malay-Polynesian languages in Island Southeast Asia (ISEA) were coupled to an agriculturally driven demic dispersal out of Taiwan 4000 years ago (4 ka). We previously addressed this question using founder analysis of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) control-region sequences to identify major lineage clusters most likely to have dispersed from Taiwan into ISEA, proposing that the dispersal had a relatively minor impact on the extant genetic structure of ISEA, and that the role of agriculture in the expansion of the Austronesian languages was therefore likely to have been correspondingly minor. Here we test these conclusions by sequencing whole mtDNAs from across Taiwan and ISEA, using their higher chronological precision to resolve the overall proportion that participated in the “out-of-Taiwan” mid-Holocene dispersal as opposed to earlier, postglacial expansions in the Early Holocene. We show that, in total, about 20 % of mtDNA lineages in the modern ISEA pool result from the “out-of-Taiwan” dispersal, with most of the remainder signifying earlier processes, mainly due to sea-level rises after the Last Glacial Maximum. Notably, we show that every one of these founder clusters previously entered Taiwan from China, 6–7 ka, where rice-farming originated, and remained distinct from the indigenous Taiwanese population until after the subsequent dispersal into ISEA Taiwan ; Economic development - Taiwan A Collaboration comprising Taiwan and mainland Chinese scientists has been built up since 1996 to pursue a experimental program in neutrino and astro-particle physics in Taiwan. A pilot experiment to be performed at the Nuclear Power Station II in Taiwan is now under intense preparation. It will make use of a 600 kg CsI(Tl) crystal calorimeter to study various neutrino interactions. The feasibility of performing a long baseline reactor neutrino experiment will also be investigated. The conceptual design and the physics to be addressed by the pilot experiment are presented.Comment: 14 pages, 8 figures, 2 table On Feb. 5 2016 (UTC), an earthquake with moment magnitude 6.4 occurred in southern Taiwan, known as the 2016 (Southern) Taiwan earthquake. In this study, evidences of seismic earthquake precursors for this earthquake event are investigated. Results show that ionospheric anomalies in Total Electric Content (TEC) can be observed before the earthquake. These anomalies were obtained by processing TEC data, where such TEC data are calculated from phase delays of signals observed at densely arranged ground-based stations in Taiwan for Global Navigation Satellite Systems. This shows that such anomalies were detected within 1 hour before the event	['563568', '8365355', '8364388', '8363882', '2493161', '968003', '52210799']	[[{'name': '/SLAC'}, {'name': '/Taiwan, Natl.

However, some extraction-free RT-qPCR techniques have recently been developed. In this study, we compared the sensitivity of traditional extraction-based, heated extraction-free, and unheated extraction-free RT-qPCR methods for SARS-CoV-2 detection in nasopharyngeal swabs from symptomatic individuals. The unheated extraction-free method showed perfect agreement with the standard extraction-based RT-qPCR. By contrast, the heat-treated technique was associated with an 8.2% false negativity rate. Unheated extraction-free RT-qPCR for the molecular diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 is a valuable alternative to the traditional extraction-based methods and may accelerate turnaround times by about two hours BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Recurrence in lymph node-negative (pN0) colorectal cancer suggests the presence of undetected occult metastases. Occult tumor burden in nodes estimated by GUCY2C RT-qPCR predicts risk of disease recurrence. This study explored the impact of the number of nodes analyzed by RT-qPCR (analytic) on the prognostic utility of occult tumor burden. METHODS: Lymph nodes (range: 2-159) from 282 prospectively enrolled pN0 colorectal cancer patients, followed for a median of 24 months (range: 2-63), were analyzed by GUCY2C RT-qPCR. Prognostic risk categorization defined using occult tumor burden was the primary outcome measure. Association of prognostic variables and risk category were defined by multivariable polytomous and semi-parametric polytomous logistic regression. RESULTS: Occult tumor burden stratified this pN0 cohort into categories of low (60%; recurrence rate (RR) = 2.3% [95% CI 0.1-4.5%]), intermediate (31%; RR = 33.3% [23.7-44.1%]), and high (9%; RR = 68.0% [46.5-85.1%], P \u3c 0.001) risk of recurrence. Beyond race and T stage, the number of analytic nodes was an independent marker of risk category (P \u3c 0.001). When \u3e12 nodes were analyzed, occult tumor burden almost completely resolved prognostic risk classification of pN0 patients. CONCLUSIONS: The prognostic utility of occult tumor burden assessed by GUCY2C RT-qPCR is dependent on the number of analytic lymph nodes Fragmented RNA from formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissue is a known obstacle to gene expression analysis. In this study, the impact of RNA integrity, gene-specific reverse transcription and targeted cDNA preamplification was quantified in terms of reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) sensitivity by measuring 48 protein coding genes on eight duplicate cultured cancer cell pellet FFPE samples and twenty cancer tissue FFPE samples. More intact RNA modestly increased gene detection sensitivity by 1.6 fold (earlier detection by 0.7 PCR cycles, 95% CI = 0.593-0.850). Application of gene-specific priming instead of whole transcriptome priming during reverse transcription further improved RT-qPCR sensitivity by a considerable 4.0 fold increase (earlier detection by 2.0 PCR cycles, 95% CI = 1.73-2.32). Targeted cDNA preamplification resulted in the strongest increase of RT-qPCR sensitivity and enabled earlier detection by an average of 172.4 fold (7.43 PCR cycles, 95% CI = 6.83-7.05). We conclude that gene-specific reverse transcription and targeted cDNA preamplification are adequate methods for accurate and sensitive RT-qPCR based gene expression analysis of FFPE material. The presented methods do not involve expensive or complex procedures and can be easily implemented in any routine RT-qPCR practice Työn tarkoituksena oli optimoida toimiva ja herkkä RT-qPCR-menetelmä enterovirusten tyypittämiseksi monistamalla enterovirusgenomin VP1-aluetta. Optimoinnissa käytettiin näytteinä plasmidiin kloonattuja virusgenomeja ja virus-RNA:ta, jotka oli eristetty tunnetuista virustyypeistä. Tutkimuksessa testattiin eri valmistajien kaupallisia qPCR-reaktiosarjoja, joiden herkkyyttä ja toimivuutta testattiin sekä perinteisellä PCR- että qPCR-laitteella. RT-qPCR-menetelmään siirryttäessä testattiin myös eri valmistajien RT-entsyymien herkkyyttä. Reaktiosarjojen herkkyys määritettiin Cp-arvojen perusteella ja tarkistamalla tuotteet agaroosigeelielektroforeesilla (AGE). Kehitettyä optimaalista RT-qPCR-menetelmää verrattiin erittäin herkkään diagnostiseen ENRI-menetelmään. Optimoidun menetelmän toimivuus testattiin tuntemattomia enterovirus-RNA-näytteitä käyttäen. Tutkimuksessa havaittiin merkittäviä eroja eri valmistajien qPCR-reaktiosarjojen välillä ja löydettiin selkeästi parhaiten toimiva reaktiosarja, joka tuotti 100 kopion herkkyyden, kun näytteenä käytettiin virus-plasmidia.. Tuntemattomista näytteistä tällä menetelmällä monistettiin VP1-alue 9/19 (47 %) tuntemattomasta enterovirusnäytteestä.The purpose of this study was to optimize the functional and sensitive RT-qPCR method for enterovirus typing by multiplying the VP1 region of the enterovirus genome. In the optimization, viral genomes cloned into plasmid and viral RNA isolated from known viral types were used as samples. In this research commercial qPCR kits by various manufacturers were tested for sensitivity and functionality with both conventional PCR and qPCR instruments. In the case of the RT-qPCR method, the sensitivity of RT enzymes from different manufacturers was also tested. The qPCR kit sensitivity was determined on the basis of the Cp values as well as by checking the products by agarose gel electrophoresis (AGE). The developed optimal RT-qPCR method was compared with the highly sensitive diagnostic ENRI method. The functionality of the optimized method was tested with unknown enterovirus RNA samples. The study found significant differences between different manufacturers’ qPCR kits and determined the most effective kit which exhibited a sensitivity of 100 copies when the viral plasmid was used as sample. With this method the VP1 region 9/19 (47 %) of unknown enterovirus samples was amplified Introduction: An increasing number of studies have investigated microRNAs (miRNAs) as potential markers of diagnosis, treatment and prognosis. So far, agreement between studies has been minimal, which may in part be explained by intratumoral heterogeneity of miRNA expression. The aim of the present study was to assess the heterogeneity of a panel of selected miRNAs in rectal cancer, using two different technical approaches. Materials and Methods: The expression of the investigated miRNAs was analysed by real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) and in situ hybridization (ISH) in tumour specimens from 27 patients with T3-4 rectal cancer. From each tumour, tissue from three different luminal localisations was examined. Inter- and intra-patient variability was assessed by calculating intraclass correlation coefficients (ICCs). Correlations between RT-qPCR and ISH were evaluated using Spearman's correlation. Results: ICCsingle (one sample from each patient) was higher than 50% for miRNA-21 and miRNA-31. For miRNA-125b, miRNA-145, and miRNA-630, ICCsingle was lower than 50%. The ICCmean (mean of three samples from each patient) was higher than 50% for miRNA-21(RT-qPCR and ISH), miRNA-125b (RT-qPCR and ISH), miRNA-145 (ISH), miRNA-630 (RT-qPCR), and miRNA-31 (RT-qPCR). For miRNA-145 (RT-qPCR) and miRNA-630 (ISH), ICCmean was lower than 50%. Spearman correlation coefficients, comparing results obtained by RT-qPCR and ISH, respectively, ranged from 0.084 to 0.325 for the mean value from each patient, and from -0.085 to 0.515 in the section including the deepest part of the tumour. Conclusion: Intratumoral heterogeneity may influence the measurement of miRNA expression and consequently the number of samples needed for representative estimates. Our findings with two different methods suggest that one sample is sufficient for adequate assessment of miRNA-21 and miRNA-31, whereas more samples would improve the assessment of miRNA-125b, miRNA-145, and miRNA-630. Interestingly, we found a poor correlation between the expression estimates obtained by RT-qPCR and ISH, respectively We give a brief overview of the necessary steps in the analysis of real-time reverse transcription quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) data. We cover determination of amplification efficiency, background correction, normalization, quality control, and statistical analysis Gene expression quantification on cultured cells using the reverse transcription quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) typically involves an RNA purification step that limits sample processing throughput and precludes parallel analysis of large numbers of samples. An approach in which cDNA synthesis is carried out on crude cell lysates instead of on purified RNA samples can offer a fast and straightforward alternative. Here, we evaluate such an approach, benchmarking Ambion's Cells-to-CT kit with the classic workflow of RNA purification and cDNA synthesis, and demonstrate its good accuracy and superior sensitivity	['3901261', '3827835', '153224367', '42536858', '42934468', '22659502', '8463811', '43361854', '31307679']	[[{'name': 'Chen, Gang'}, {'name': 'De Grève, Jacques'}, {'name': 'Kronenberger, Peter'}, {'name': 'Teugels, Erik'}], [{'name': 'A Del Vecchio'}, {'name': 'A Malik'}, {'name': 'A Ohlin'}, {'name': 'BM Hansen'}, {'name': 'CM Cotten'}, {'name': 'D Kaufman'}, {'name': 'H Tsujih'}, {'name': 'HH Frayha'}, {'name': 'Hiroaki Sato'}, {'name': 'Hiromichi Shoji'}, {'name': 'HS Lam'}, {'name': 'JA Jordan'}, {'name': 'JA Jordan'}, {'name': 'JA Jordan'}, {'name': 'JA Kellogg'}, {'name': 'K Matsuda'}, {'name': 'K Matsuda'}, {'name': 'Ken Hisata'}, {'name': 'Koji Nomoto'}, {'name': 'KY Chan'}, {'name': 'M Wada'}, {'name': 'Makoto Fujimori'}, {'name': 'Mitsutaka Komatsu'}, {'name': 'N Laforgia'}, {'name': 'Nobuaki Matsunaga'}, {'name': 'PC Ng'}, {'name': 'PC Woo'}, {'name': 'PR Neal'}, {'name': 'RP Peters'}, {'name': 'S Sakaguchi'}, {'name': 'S Shang'}, {'name': 'Satoru Nagata'}, {'name': 'T Reier-Nilsen'}, {'name': 'Takashi Asahara'}, {'name': 'Toshiaki Shimizu'}, {'name': 'YD Wu'}, {'name': 'Yuichiro Yamashiro'}], [{'name': 'Bruzzone B.'}, {'name': 'Caligiuri P.'}, {'name': 'De Pace V.'}, {'name': 'Domnich A.'}, {'name': 'Orsi A.'}, {'name': 'Pennati B.

8f4f7846-dfea-4ac5-9e23-882098bbea87	cytokinesis	We present a model for the actin contractile ring of adherent animal cells. The model suggests that the actin concentration within the ring and consequently the power that the ring exerts both increase during contraction. We demonstrate the crucial role of actin polymerization and depolymerization throughout cytokinesis, and the dominance of viscous dissipation in the dynamics. The physical origin of two phases in cytokinesis dynamics ("biphasic cytokinesis") follows from a limitation on the actin density. The model is consistent with a wide range of measurements of the midzone of dividing animal cells.Comment: PACS numbers: 87.16.Ka, 87.16.Ac   http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16197254   http://www.weizmann.ac.il/complex/tlusty/papers/PhysRevLett2005.pd Centrioles organize the centrosome, and accurate control of their number is critical for the maintenance of genomic integrity. Centrioles duplicate once per cell cycle, and duplication is coordinated by Polo-like kinase 4 (Plk4). We previously demonstrated that Plk4 accumulation is autoregulated by its own kinase activity. However, loss of heterozygosity of Plk4 in mouse embryonic fibroblasts has been proposed to cause cytokinesis failure as a primary event, leading to centrosome amplification and gross chromosomal abnormalities. Using targeted gene disruption, we show that human epithelial cells with one inactivated Plk4 allele undergo neither cytokinesis failure nor increase in centrosome amplification. Plk4 is shown to localize exclusively at the centrosome, with none in the spindle midbody. Substantial depletion of Plk4 by small interfering RNA leads to loss of centrioles and subsequent spindle defects that lead to a modest increase in the rate of cytokinesis failure. Therefore, Plk4 is a centriole-localized kinase that does not directly regulate cytokinesis Cytokinesis, the final phase of cell division, is necessary to form two distinct daughter cells with correct distribution of genomic and cytoplasmic materials. Its failure provokes genetically unstable states, such as tetraploidization and polyploidization, which can contribute to tumorigenesis. Aurora-B kinase controls multiple cytokinetic events, from chromosome condensation to abscission when the midbody is severed. We have previously shown that HIPK2, a kinase involved in DNA damage response and development, localizes at the midbody and contributes to abscission by phosphorylating extrachromosomal histone H2B at Ser14. Of relevance, HIPK2-defective cells do not phosphorylate H2B and do not successfully complete cytokinesis leading to accumulation of binucleated cells, chromosomal instability, and increased tumorigenicity. However, how HIPK2 and H2B are recruited to the midbody during cytokinesis is still unknown. Here, we show that regardless of their direct (H2B) and indirect (HIPK2) binding of chromosomal DNA, both H2B and HIPK2 localize at the midbody independently of nucleic acids. Instead, by using mitotic kinase-specific inhibitors in a spatio-temporal regulated manner, we found that Aurora-B kinase activity is required to recruit both HIPK2 and H2B to the midbody. Molecular characterization showed that Aurora-B directly binds and phosphorylates H2B at Ser32 while indirectly recruits HIPK2 through the central spindle components MgcRacGAP and PRC1. Thus, among different cytokinetic functions, Aurora-B separately recruits HIPK2 and H2B to the midbody and these activities contribute to faithful cytokinesis The anaphase spindle determines the position of the cytokinesis furrow, such that the contractile ring assembles in an equatorial zone between the two spindle poles. Contractile ring formation is mediated by RhoA activation at the equator by the centralspindlin complex and midzone microtubules. Astral microtubules also inhibit RhoA accumulation at the poles. In the Caenorhabditis elegans one-cell embryo, the astral microtubule-dependent pathway requires anillin, NOP-1, and LET-99. LET-99 is well characterized for generating the asymmetric cortical localization of the Gα-dependent force-generating complex that positions the spindle during asymmetric division. However, whether the role of LET-99 in cytokinesis is specific to asymmetric division and whether it acts through Gα to promote furrowing are unclear. Here we show that LET-99 contributes to furrowing in both asymmetrically and symmetrically dividing cells, independent of its function in spindle positioning and Gα regulation. LET-99 acts in a pathway parallel to anillin and is required for myosin enrichment into the contractile ring. These and other results suggest a positive feedback model in which LET-99 localizes to the presumptive cleavage furrow in response to the spindle and myosin. Once positioned there, LET-99 enhances myosin accumulation to promote furrowing in both symmetrically and asymmetrically dividing cells Recently it was shown that both recycling endosome and endosomal sorting complex required for transport (ESCRT) components are required for cytokinesis, in which they are believed to act in a sequential manner to bring about secondary ingression and abscission, respectively. However, it is not clear how either of these complexes is targeted to the midbody and whether their delivery is coordinated. The trafficking of membrane vesicles between different intracellular organelles involves the formation of soluble N-ethylmalei­mide–sensitive factor attachment protein receptor (SNARE) complexes. Although membrane traffic is known to play an important role in cytokinesis, the contribution and identity of intracellular SNAREs to cytokinesis remain unclear. Here we demonstrate that syntaxin 16 is a key regulator of cytokinesis, as it is required for recruitment of both recycling endosome–associated Exocyst and ESCRT machinery during late telophase, and therefore that these two distinct facets of cytokinesis are inextricably linked Microtubule severing enzymes regulate microtubule dynamics in a wide range of organisms and are implicated in important cell cycle processes such as mitotic spindle assembly and disassembly, chromosome movement and cytokinesis. Here we explore the function of several microtubule severing enzyme homologues, the katanins (KAT80, KAT60a, KAT60b and KAT60c), spastin (SPA) and fidgetin (FID) in the bloodstream stage of the African trypanosome parasite, Trypanosoma brucei. The trypanosome cytoskeleton is microtubule based and remains assembled throughout the cell cycle, necessitating its remodelling during cytokinesis. Using RNA interference to deplete individual proteins, we show that the trypanosome katanin and spastin homologues are non-redundant and essential for bloodstream form proliferation. Further, cell cycle analysis revealed that these proteins play essential but discrete roles in cytokinesis. The KAT60 proteins each appear to be important during the early stages of cytokinesis, while downregulation of KAT80 specifically inhibited furrow ingression and SPA depletion prevented completion of abscission. In contrast, RNA interference of FID did not result in any discernible effects. We propose that the stable microtubule cytoskeleton of T. brucei necessitates the coordinated action of a family of katanins and spastin to bring about the cytoskeletal remodelling necessary to complete cell divisio Septins are a family of GTP-binding, membrane-interacting cytoskeletal proteins, highly conserved and essential in all eukaryotes (with the exception of plants). Septins play important roles in a number of cellular events that involve membrane remodeling and compartmentalization. One such event is cytokinesis, the last stage of cell division. While cytokinesis is ultimately achieved via the mechanical contraction of an actomyosin ring at the septum, determination of the location where cytokinesis will take place, and recruitment of factors involved in signaling events leading to septation requires the activity of septins. We are working towards dissecting the properties of septins from the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, where they were first discovered as cell cycle mutants. In our studies we have employed several complementary electron microscopy techniques to describe the organization and structure of septins both in vitro and in situ The mitotic protein polo-like kinase 4 (PLK4) plays a critical role in centrosome duplication for cell division. By using immunofluorescence, we confirm that PLK4 is localized to centrosomes. In addition, we find that phospho-PLK4 (pPLK4) is cleaved and distributed to kinetochores (metaphase and anaphase), spindle midzone/cleavage furrow (anaphase and telophase), and midbody (cytokinesis) during cell division in immortalized epithelial cells as well as breast, ovarian, and colorectal cancer cells. The distribution of pPLK4 midzone/cleavage furrow and midbody positions pPLK4 to play a functional role in cytokinesis. Indeed, we found that inhibition of PLK4 kinase activity with a small-molecule inhibitor, CFI-400945, prevents translocation to the spindle midzone/cleavage furrow and prevents cellular abscission, leading to the generation of cells with polyploidy, increased numbers of duplicated centrosomes, and vulnerability to anaphase or mitotic catastrophe. The regulatory role of PLK4 in cytokinesis makes it a potential target for therapeutic intervention in appropriately selected cancers	['713159', '37901552', '55033895', '86029522', '7226193', '2445447', '85868084', '85857465']	[[{'name': 'D.

9484f1e8-7333-4d91-bff5-b7dc45dc8f14	telemedicina	Telemedicine is used more and more frequently worldwide. It is increasingly popular in North America, Australia, South Africa, as well as the Scandinavian countries. However, it is not commonly used in Hungary despite various attempts,  which is presumably due to earlier dismissive governmental attitude. In this paper the authors analyze ethical, legal and financial aspects of telemedicine from the viewpoints of physicians and patients, too. The results indicate that it cannot be clearly decided whether telemedicine is worth to apply at present. Further, introduction of telemedicine should be based on experience gained in local application El cuidado de pacientes crónicos es el gran reto que deberán afrontar los sistemas de salud en el siglo XXI. Sin embargo, su estructura actual, orientada hacia el tratamiento puntual y episódico de enfermedades, no está preparada para las necesidades que surgen en este nuevo escenario. Es necesario, por lo tanto, un cambio del paradigma de cuidado, que reoriente los sistemas de salud hacia el tratamiento continuado e integral de enfermedades crónicas. En su concepción más clásica la Telemedicina proporciona facilidades de comunicación y envío de datos de monitorización, punto a punto, entre el profesional médico y el paciente o entre dos profesionales médicos. Los sistemas de Telemedicina para cuidado de enfermedades crónicas, como la diabetes, deben evolucionar desde estos esquemas punto a punto hacia nuevos sistemas de Telemedicina multi-acceso, flexibles, personalizados y abiertos, que permitan afrontar el reto de ofrecer el conocimiento adecuado, a la persona que lo necesita, en el momento y lugar más idóneo y con un coste razonable. La principal aportación de esta tesis la constituye una arquitectura multi-acceso de Telemedicina diseñada para facilitar el cuidado compartido de pacientes diabéticos. A partir de esta arquitectura, que se ha denominado AGORA, se podrán construir Sistemas de Telemedicina que permitirán la creación de espacios virtuales de trabajo cooperativo en los que los miembros del equipo de cuidado de un paciente con diabetes puedan colaborar con el objetivo común de mejorar el estado metabólico y la calidad de vida del paciente. Como segunda aportación, la tesis propone un modelo de dominio genérico del cuidado convencional y telemédico de pacientes con diabetes. Este modelo contiene, con un alto nivel de abstracción, descripciones de todos los actores, lugares, documentos, recursos y procesos que en general pueden formar parte del cuidado de un paciente diabético en una organización sanitaria cualquiera, además de las posibles relaciones existentes entre dichas entidades. El uso de este modelo permite estudiar de una manera rápida, sencilla y formal las organizaciones en las que se vaya a implantar la arquitectura de Telemedicina anteriormente descrita, de modo que se puedan adaptar los servicios ofrecidos a las características concretas de la organización. La tercera aportación de la tesis la constituye la evaluación de un Sistema de Telemedicina basado en la arquitectura anterior, que se ha instalado en un entorno clínico real y se ha sometido a un proceso de evaluación que ha incluido aspectos tecnológicos, de usabilidad, económicos y de impacto real en el estado metabólico de los pacientes con diabetes. Los resultados experimentales de la evaluación del sistema de Telemedicina han permitido corroborar las hipótesis de investigación y han demostrado que la arquitectura definida y desarrollada en esta tesis es capaz de satisfacer las principales necesidades de comunicación, coordinación, colaboración y acceso a información clínica requeridos en el cuidado compartido de pacientes crónicos. El principal resultado de la evaluación del sistema ha sido un mejor control metabólico de los pacientes y una mejora de la calidad asistencial. A su vez, los resultados de este trabajo de investigación permiten vislumbrar cómo los nuevos procedimientos telemédicos contribuirán a la creación de los nuevos modelos de cuidado de pacientes crónicos imprescindibles en los sistemas sanitarios en las próximas décadas OBJECTIVE: To systematically review the literature on the implementation of e-health to identify: (i) barriers and facilitators to e-health implementation, and (ii) outstanding gaps in research on the subject.METHODS: MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, PSYCINFO and the Cochrane Library were searched for reviews published between 1 January 1995 and 17 March 2009. Studies had to be systematic reviews, narrative reviews, qualitative metasyntheses or meta-ethnographies of e-health implementation. Abstracts and papers were double screened and data were extracted on country of origin; e-health domain; publication date; aims and methods; databases searched; inclusion and exclusion criteria and number of papers included. Data were analysed qualitatively using normalization process theory as an explanatory coding framework.FINDINGS: Inclusion criteria were met by 37 papers; 20 had been published between 1995 and 2007 and 17 between 2008 and 2009. Methodological quality was poor: 19 papers did not specify the inclusion and exclusion criteria and 13 did not indicate the precise number of articles screened. The use of normalization process theory as a conceptual framework revealed that relatively little attention was paid to: (i) work directed at making sense of e-health systems, specifying their purposes and benefits, establishing their value to users and planning their implementation; (ii) factors promoting or inhibiting engagement and participation; (iii) effects on roles and responsibilities; (iv) risk management, and (v) ways in which implementation processes might be reconfigured by user-produced knowledge.CONCLUSION: The published literature focused on organizational issues, neglecting the wider social framework that must be considered when introducing new technologies.<br/ The emergence of Covid-19 and all the restrictions that the pandemic has brought with it can affect contraception processes in women, which is why telemedicine is a very useful tool. For this reason, it has been proposed to develop this bibliographic review article on contraception and telemedicine to provide gynecological guidance, specifically contraception through telemedicine during the pandemic. A narrative-type bibliographic review was carried out, whose information was obtained from databases that met the proposed inclusion and exclusion criteria. A total of 34 bibliographies that met the established parameters were selected. Telemedicine refers to the use of information and communication technology to provide and support medical care. The articles and scientific research consulted, confirm positive experiences with the use of telemedicine to receive contraceptive advice during the Covid-19 pandemic. Additionally, patients appreciated the convenience of telemedicine and valued the virtual counseling experience. The Covid-19 pandemic has lead to a widespread implementation of telemedicine; however, there is minimal evidence regarding it and its relationship with gynecology. Therefore, the implementation of clinical guidelines is suggested to improve practices of telemedicine in the patient population that requires the use of contraception. Keywords: contraception, Covid-19, telemedicine. Resumen Introducción: La aparición de la enfermedad por coronavirus de 2019 (Covid-19) y todas las restricciones que ha traído consigo la pandemia puede afectar los procesos de anticoncepción en las mujeres, por lo que la telemedicina resulta una herramienta muy útil; por tal razón, se ha propuesto desarrollar el presente artículo de revisión bibliográfica sobre anticoncepción y telemedicina para brindar orientación ginecológica, específicamente de anticoncepción a través de la telemedicina en tiempos de pandemia. Metodología: Se realizó una revisión bibliográfica de tipo narrativa, cuya información ha sido obtenida de bases de datos que cumplían con los criterios de inclusión y exclusión propuestos. Se seleccionaron un total de 34 bibliografías que cumplían con los parámetros establecidos. Desarrollo y Discusión: La telemedicina se refiere al uso de la tecnología de la información y las comunicaciones para brindar y apoyar la atención médica. Los artículos e investigaciones científicas consultadas confirman experiencias positivas, con el empleo de visitas de telemedicina para recibir asesoramiento sobre anticonceptivos durante la pandemia de Covid-19. Además, los pacientes apreciaron la conveniencia de las visitas de telemedicina y valoraron la experiencia de asesoramiento virtual. Conclusión: La pandemia de Covid-19 está conduciendo a una implementación generalizada de la telemedicina, sin embargo, existe evidencia mínima en torno a esta y su relación con la ginecología, por lo tanto, se sugiere la implementación de guías clínicas para mejorar las prácticas de telemedicina en la población de pacientes que requiere usar métodos anticonceptivos. Palabras Clave: anticoncepción, Covid-19, telemedicina Absztrakt                   Az utóbbi évtizedek telekommunikációs és informatikai-technológiai fejlődése az                      egészségügyi ellátásban is jelentős változásokat hozott, és kialakult az                      orvostudomány új ága, a telemedicina. Az elmúlt 20 évben a telekommunikációs                      hálózatok folyamatos fejlődése, az internet megjelenése, az okostelefonok                      térhódítása lehetővé tette a telemedicina ugrásszerű fejlődését, így mára már                      számos eszköz és alkalmazás áll rendelkezésünkre, ezzel párhuzamosan pedig a                      szakirodalmi publikációk és hivatkozások száma is exponenciálisan növekszik. A                      terület egyik legdinamikusabban fejlődő ágává a teledermatológia, azaz a                      telemedicina bőrgyógyászati alkalmazása vált, mivel a bőrön található                      elváltozások jól láthatóak és hozzáférhetőek, az új eszközökkel pedig komolyabb                      beavatkozás nélkül is dokumentálhatóak. A módszer Magyarországon eddig még nem                      honosodott meg, pedig alkalmazásával a betegellátás hatékonyabbá, gyorsabbá és                      olcsóbbá válhat. A szerzők célja, hogy áttekintsék a bőrgyógyászat                      távkonzultációs gyakorlatának külföldi tapasztalatait és legfontosabb                      eredményeit. Kiemelik a teledermatológia jellegzetességeit, a vizsgálatok                      megbízhatóságát, a módszer ellátórendszerre gyakorolt hatását, valamint a                      szubjektív és objektív előnyöket és hátrányokat. Orv. Hetil., 2016,                          157(10), 363–369 Firstly described in 1970, telemedicine is perceived as a way to receive care of health in distance. The COVID-19 pandemic has created the need for implementation of telemedicine services in order to provide safer healthcare options. Perception and satisfaction with telemedicine are linked factors to the use of these systems and understanding a population’s current perspective of telemedicine can ensure their satisfaction now, and in the future. In our primary study, by investigating current telemedicine implementation in Portugal through informal interviews, results have shown that we currently face many obstacles in education and training of telemedicine, leading to poor use and satisfaction with the systems. Through our second study, we statistically assess possible affecting factors to the relationship between these two variables, such as the quality of the interface and interaction, trust in the system, and self-efficacy in using these technologies. This study has created a basic correlation structure for perception-based factors impacting satisfaction, making it a valuable asset to consider when building or creating tools for ensuring acceptance and future use of this service.Inicialmente descrita em 1970, a telemedicina é vista como uma forma de receber cuidados de saúde à distância. A pandemia do COVID-19 criou a necessidade de implementação de serviços de telemedicina, a fim de proporcionar opções de cuidados de saúde mais seguras. A perceção e a satisfação com a telemedicina são fatores ligados à utilização destes sistemas, e a compreensão da atual perspetiva sobre a telemedicina por parte da população, pode garantir a sua satisfação agora, e no futuro. Num primeiro estudo, ao investigar a atual implementação da telemedicina em Portugal, através de entrevistas informais, os resultados mostraram que atualmente enfrentamos muitos obstáculos na transmissão de informação e formação da telemedicina, levando a um uso inadequado e baixa satisfação com os sistemas. Através do nosso segundo estudo, avaliamos estatisticamente possíveis fatores que afetem a relação entre estas duas variáveis, tais como a qualidade da interface tecnológica e interação, a confiança no sistema, e a autoeficácia na utilização destas tecnologias. Este estudo criou uma estrutura de correlação básica para fatores baseados na perceção que impactam a satisfação, tornando-o um guia valioso a considerar ao construir ou criar ferramentas para garantir a aceitação e utilização futura deste serviço Background and Aims: Continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) devices could be useful for real-time management of diabetes therapy. In particular, CGM information could be used in real time to predict future glucose levels in order to prevent hypo-/hyperglycemic events. This article proposes a new online method for predicting future glucose concentration levels from CGM data.    Methods: The predictor is implemented with an artificial neural network model (NNM). The inputs of the NNM are the values provided by the CGM sensor during the preceding 20 min, while the output is the prediction of glucose concentration at the chosen prediction horizon (PH) time. The method performance is assessed using datasets from two different CGM systems (nine subjects using the Medtronic [Northridge, CA] Guardian® and six subjects using the Abbott [Abbott Park, IL] Navigator®). Three different PHs are used: 15, 30, and 45 min. The NNM accuracy has been estimated by using the root mean square error (RMSE) and prediction delay.    Results: The RMSE is around 10, 18, and 27 mg/dL for 15, 30, and 45 min of PH, respectively. The prediction delay is around 4, 9, and 14 min for upward trends and 5, 15, and 26 min for downward trends, respectively. A comparison with a previously published technique, based on an autoregressive model (ARM), has been performed. The comparison shows that the proposed NNM is more accurate than the ARM, with no significant deterioration in the prediction delay	['9339329', '5167532', '133078', '152444903', '24962211', '143165053', '5173570']	[[{'name': 'Bendes R'}, {'name': 'Daragó, László János'}, {'name': 'Dinya, Elek'}, {'name': 'Ispan F'}, {'name': 'Jung Z'}], [{'name': 'García Olaya, Angel'}], [{'name': 'Adaji'}, {'name': 'Balfour'}, {'name': 'Botsis'}, {'name': 'Broens'}, {'name': 'Carl May'}, {'name': 'Catherine O’Donnell'}, {'name': 'Chaudhry'}, {'name': 'Copen'}, {'name': 'Demaerschalk'}, {'name': 'Elizabeth Murray'}, {'name': 'Elwyn'}, {'name': 'Fitzpatrick'}, {'name': 'Frances S Mair'}, {'name': 'Frank Sullivan'}, {'name': 'Gagnon'}, {'name': 'Gruber'}, {'name': 'Hebert'}, {'name': 'Hilty'}, {'name': 'Jarvis-Selinger'}, {'name': 'Jennett'}, {'name': 'Jennett'}, {'name': 'Jha'}, {'name': 'Jimison'}, {'name': 'Johnson'}, {'name': 'Jones'}, {'name': 'Kawamoto'}, {'name': 'Kukafka'}, {'name': 'Leatt'}, {'name': 'Liberati'}, {'name': 'Lu'}, {'name': 'Ludwick'}, {'name': 'Mack'}, {'name': 'Mashima'}, {'name': 'May'}, {'name': 'May'}, {'name': 'May'}, {'name': 'May'}, {'name': 'Mollon'}, {'name': 'Murray'}, {'name': 'Ohinmaa'}, {'name': 'Oroviogoicoechea'}, {'name': 'Orwat'}, {'name': 'Papshev'}, {'name': 'Peleg'}, {'name': 'Shekelle'}, {'name': 'Studer'}, {'name': 'Tracy Finch'}, {'name': 'van Rosse'}, {'name': 'Vreeman'}, {'name': 'Waller'}, {'name': 'Watson'}, {'name': 'Yarbrough'}, {'name': 'Yusof'}], [{'name': 'Naranjo, IE'}, {'name': 'Ochoa, AD'}], [{'name': 'Bari, Ferenc'}, {'name': 'Danis, Judit'}, {'name': 'Forczek, Erzsébet'}], [{'name': 'Hassam, Inaara Salim'}], [{'name': 'A. de Leiva'}, {'name': 'A.

The need for better conversion technologies is a driving force behind many recent developments in biology, materials, and especially nanoscience The production, observation and manipulation of very small objects is a tour de force, but these objects, which could infiltrate anywhere without being seen, may arouse suspicion. To assess the situation at best, we describe the activity of a nanoscience research institution, some of the methods used there, the spirit of its researchers and their attitude towards risk.Comment: article accept\'e pour publication dans les C.R. Physique. El\'ement   d'un dossier 'Nanosciences et nanotechnologies: esp\'erances et   inqui\'etudes". D'autres articles de ce dossier, ainsi que la version   fran\c{c}aise de cet articles, seront \'egalement soumis \`a HA The prospect of medium/high field superconducting magnets using second generation (2G) HTS tapes is approaching reality with continued enhancement in the performance of these conductors. While the cryogenic stability and quench propagation are fundamental issues for the design and safe operation of superconducting magnets, there is insufficient understanding and experimental data for 2G HTS conductors, in particular for the high field scenario at low temperature (&lt;77 K) where the current sharing regime is much larger than in low temperature superconductors. The present work includes a systematic characterization of the relevant thermal-electrical properties used for both qualitative discussion and numerical analysis. Direct measurements of one dimensional adiabatic quench initiation and propagation of a stabilizer-free 2G conductor have been carried out with spatial-temporal recording of temperature and voltage following the deposition of varying local heat pulses to the conductor at different temperatures between 30 K and 77 K carrying different transport currents. The minimum quench energy, and the heat generation in the minimum propagation zone (MPZ) have been obtained as a function of temperature and transport current. The results show quench features unique to HTS such as an increasing MPZ with transport current and higher quench energies at lower temperatures. The experimental results are discussed in the context of current sharing over a large temperature range Thin films nanometrology is an emerging field in nanoscience as the synthesis, processing and applications of nanostructured thin films require an in-depth knowledge of their elastic constants. The elastic energy of a surface acoustic wave propagating in a solid medium, is concentrated at the interface between the solid and air (or a sufficiently rarified medium); consequently, high frequency surface acoustic waves with sub-micrometer wavelengths are an extraordinary tool for a qualitative and quantitative elastic characterization of thin films. In this article, a short review is presented to describe the main ultrasound techniques based on surface acoustic waves for thin films characterization and to highlight the probing limits of acoustic nanometrology Nanoscience and nanotechnology have been described as a research area that integrates many scientific and engineering disciplines. However, the integration of disciplines is so complex that the disciplinarity of nanoscience and nanotechnology remains undefined. As a result, the nanoscience and nanotechnology area is viewed as multidisciplinary, or interdisciplinary science, or even as a separate discipline and there is no consensus regarding its disciplinarity. The previous studies conducted in order to describe the disciplinarity associated with this area have focused mainly on political, institutional and external factors while the cognitive aspects of disciplinarity of nanoscience and nanotechnology are still less understood. As a consequence, what is needed from the curricula and training programmes to ensure the growth of this area is not fully understood. When there are strong predictions about the need for an extensive workforce in the nanoscience and nanotechnology area but the disciplinarity associated with it is less understood, it can have an adverse effect on the future of this area. This research fills the gap by aiming to achieve a greater understanding of the nanoscience and nanotechnology area and its associated disciplinarity. This research focused on examining postgraduate researchers’ experiences of nanoscience and nanotechnology research to explore the disciplinarity, knowledge, skills and competences associated with nanoscience research so that a deeper understanding of this area can be achieved. This research was conducted using hermeneutic interpretive phenomenological methodology to collect and interpret data from twenty five individual semi-structured interviews with postgraduate researchers working in the nanoscience and iii nanotechnology area. The research methodology was influenced by Max van Manen’s ideas of hermeneutic interpretive phenomenology and it was reshaped to best suit the research context and purpose. Examining the researchers’ experiences of nanoscience research made it possible to understand how postgraduate researchers perceive, understand and conduct nanoscience research. Further, the examination portrayed what knowledge, skills and competences the postgraduate researchers have applied when working in this area. The findings from this interpretive study revealed that the postgraduate researchers experienced the nanoscience and nanotechnology area essentially as a ‘boundary spanning’ experience which described their skills of crossing the disciplinary boundaries in order to understand nanoscience research. Furthermore, the researchers experienced mapping, i.e. their research was evaluated and judged by the researchers from other disciplines. The findings also indicated that the nanoscience and nanotechnology research displayed characteristics of both multidisciplinarity and interdisciplinarity and therefore they suggested that promoting any one particular approach and aiming to develop the researchers for either a multidisciplinary or interdisciplinary platform would not be appropriate for this area. The postgraduate researchers needed the skills to work together with researchers from other disciplines and become good at boundary spanning in the nanoscience area. The interpretive findings were taken back to the postgraduate researchers through a quantitative survey and their agreement with the interpretations further enhanced the credibility of this hermeneutic phenomenological study. The hermeneutic phenomenological research gave a new way to explore the complex nanoscience area by examining the postgraduate researchers’ experiences and this research provided an enhanced understanding of the nanoscience and nanotechnology area and its disciplinarity	['2255760', '759642', '222645', '30338884', '84231083']	[[{'name': 'George W.

9b6de068-280c-4ff0-9fe8-474c783a7b22	femme fatale	Film noir stereotypes female characters through the archetype of the femme fatale: the fatal woman or the fatal wife. However, critics are currently re-examining the femme fatale. For example, in the second paragraph of Film Noir’s Progressive Portrayal of Women, Stephanie Blaser and John Blaser write “even when [film noir] depicts women as dangerous and worthy of destruction, [it] also shows that women are confined by the roles traditionally open to them.” With Blaser and Blaser’s understanding of the double nature of the femme fatale in mind, can one say that the femme fatale generates fear of feminism? Can one read her as a martyr and a heroine? I will examine facets of the femme fatale in modern and classic iterations, while contextualizing women’s historical roles in society. Historically, the femme fatale originated as a response to World War II. As Gary Morris notes in the last paragraph of “High Gallows: Revisiting Jacques Tourneur’s Out of the Past,” “[she] embodies post-war fears that women, having contributed mightily to the war effort and moved into ‘men’s work,’ might abandon the domestic sphere entirely... and even the most powerful men around her can’t comprehend or control the violent forces she represents.” Additionally, the essay will focus on Phyllis in Billy Wilder’s Double Indemnity, Kathie in Jacques Tourneur’s Out of the Past, and Evelyn in Roman Polanski’s Chinatown. To include a literary dimension, I will also provide a close reading of Velma in Farewell, My Lovely by Raymond Chandler.  To comprehend the femme fatale and her relationship to women’s roles in Western society, these women must be placed in a broader, historical spectrum. Transhistorical examination of the femme fatale will be achieved by examining one of the most prominent characters in Judeo-Christian society, Eve. The close reading of this proto-femme fatale will specifically examine her role in Genesis and Milton’s Paradise Lost. Closely reading the femme fatale is important because it contextualizes modern women’s roles, both locally and globally, and aids in the drive towards gender equality This thesis examines how contemporary femme fatales operate under patriarchal notions and expectations of gender and femininity to get away with their crimes. Whereas classic femme fatales were relegated to a tragic fate—either through death, incarceration or other forms of subjugation—contemporary femme fatales now have the narrative possibility of using their sexuality, intellect and agency to get away with their crimes at the expense of the male hero. Breaking with the traditional analysis centering around the femme fatale in her relation to men and male anxieties regarding feminine sexual difference, I propose a queer reading of the contemporary femme fatale that accredits the femme fatale for her active cunning and independence through an examination of her enhanced characteristics which make it possible for her to succeed under the continuous constraints of the patriarchy. The films examined are: The Last Seduction (1994), Gone Girl (2014), Body Heat (1981), Nightmare Alley (2021), Bound (1996) and Basic Instinct (1992). While the popularity of the femme fatale continues, there are still relatively few examples of femme fatales who get away with their crimes as well as a continued lack of scholarship that discusses the intricacies of the femme fatale absent from her theorization as a beacon of male anxieties. However, this project remains hopeful and advocates for a more diverse representation and an in increase scholastic conversation surrounding femme fatales in contemporary cinema This thesis offers a reappraisal of the recurring figure of the femme fatale within Decadent art  and literature of the nineteenth century. Despite the ubiquity of studies concerning the femme  fatale, most notably within genres such as Film Noir and Romanticism, the Decadent femme  fatale has often been relegated to a single chapter or footnote within these studies. It is here the  purpose of this thesis to rectify this critical disregard.  Combining multiple disciplines (literature, aesthetics, history, mythology and  psychology) each of the four chapters of this thesis will locate the femme fatale within  nineteenth-century European Decadent texts as represented as a specific objet d’art: the  haunted portrait, the corpse-doll, the fragmented sculpture, and the mutilated and/or sculpted  body of the androgyne. Invoking Harold Bloom’s theory of the anxiety of influence, the  influence and trajectory of each chapter’s respective femme fatale will be traced from the midnineteenth century through to the fin de siècle. By tracing the lineage of the aesthetic impression  made by French Decadent writers of the mid-nineteenth century (such as Théophile Gautier  and Charles Baudelaire) upon subsequent French and British writers and artists of the latenineteenth century (such as Dante Gabriel Rossetti, Algernon Charles Swinburne, Walter Pater,  Rachilde, and Vernon Lee), this thesis interrogates how the re/construction and usage of the  Decadent femme fatale was utilized as a means of exploring ulterior philosophies of classical  beauty and a fluid range of forbidden sexualities, including androgyny and homoeroticism.  Offering interdisciplinary readings of the nineteenth-century Decadent femme fatale,  this thesis shows the different ways in which nineteenth-century Decadent writers and artists  move beyond the femme fatale’s malevolence, though without losing sight of it, to explore the  mysterious relationships between life and death, art and artifice, pleasure and pain, and the seen  and unseen openThe thesis starts by giving a general definition of femme fatale and by talking about women’s role during the Nineteenth century, myth and mythological creatures. It then moves towards the femme fatale in romantic poetry, analysing selected poems of John Keats and Percy Bysshe Shelley. Finally, it discusses the fatal woman in victorian poetry with selected poems of Dante Gabriel Rossetti The femme fatale, a quasi-eternal figure of female transgression and retributory violence, has gradually entered popular culture’s symbolic lexicon as representative of mainstream feminism and postmodern femininity. Tracing the development of the femme fatale into a feminist pop culture icon necessitates establishing her sociopolitical status in the late modern era through her presence in Victorian sensational literature. The femme’s translation from the Victorian context to the American mediascape presages her evolving presence in three cinematic eras: classic film noir, neo-conservative retro noir, and millennial neo-noir. Feminist film criticism tends to identify the femme fatale as a protofeminist, a productive transgressor of social norms whose worth has only been posteriorly discovered. In opposition to this reading, I propose that the femme’s transgressive, exploitive, and consumerist character has been designed by a media industry eager to retain cathartically satiated female consumers. While traditional noir narratives repair the femme’s social rupture through her death or punishment, post-classic noirs respond to feminist approval by celebrating and prolonging the femme’s extralegal power. This incremental narrative change shows the femme emerging as not only an acceptable model for female social behavior, but a dominant ideal in the postfeminist age, one paradoxically supported by the very system it purports to dismantle. Her transgressive status claims a modicum of effectiveness and authenticity during her deployment in Victorian and post-war texts, when existing barricades to female agency rationalize the figure’s desperate methods. However, as gender politics advance and the femme fatale continues to revenge herself against a bygone world order, the figure begins to bear witness to a problematic nostalgia within feminism for the galvanizing effects of oppression. The continued conflation of the femme’s selfishness and destructivity with social restructure requires contemporary texts to theatrically reinvigorate a paradigm of oppression equal to her crimes. The issue at stake in the popularity of this conflict-based feminism lies in how the postmodern femme fatale makes superficial progress toward female ascendency but comprehends an underlying regression toward female subordination This project seeks to explore female monstrosity, specifically the femme fatale, in Gothic literature and its reflection of the shifting gender norms of the nineteenth century. The late 1790s experienced a distinct narrowing of female gender roles. While authors like Mary Wollstonecraft and Mary Hays publish during the eighteenth century, a backlash against such feminist voices took hold as a resurgence of spheres ideology and more traditional gender norms came into vogue. This particular shift in attitudes towards female gender norms is reflected in Scottish poet Anne Bannerman’s work as well as English novelist Charlotte Dacre’s Zofloya. Both authors’s works exhibit early inquiries into female gender roles and express anxiety about the negative impact they had upon society as a whole. Their femme fatales demonstrate the contradictory and destructive nature of gender roles at the beginning of the nineteenth century, but neither author appears able to articulate any solution to those issues. Bram Stoker’s Dracula at the close of the nineteenth century utilizes the same femme fatale trope, yet Mina Harker exhibits more constructive capabilities than her terrifying predecessors This paper analyses the femme fatale archetype and its representations in literature and movies. Its aim is to explore whether they represent feminist heroes who changed the traditional roles of women in society or whether they are stereotypical characters represented as male fantasies objectified into sex symbols based on the prejudices and injustices of patriarchal society. The femme fatale archetype is analysed in 1862 Mary Elizabeth Braddon’s novel Lady Audley’s Secret, 1940 Raymond Chandler’s novel Farewell, My Lovely, 1961 Blake Edwards’ movie Breakfast at Tiffany’s and 1992 Paul Verhoeven’s movie Basic Instinct. The theoretical framework of the paper explores the influence that feminism and feminist literary criticism had on the shaping of the femme fatale character and it also explores the feminist point of view on the character and its representations in literature and movies. The main part of the paper analyses the femme fatale archetype in the mentioned novels and movies and its relationship with other male and female characters. It explores the way these women challenged the existing patriarchal system and how they were punished for their unconventional behaviour. If they succeeded in refusing to play the traditional women’s role, they were given the most negative characteristics. In addition, it also analyses the noir genre in which this archetype is most frequently present and the influence the World Wars had on shaping this genre and the femme fatale In The Contemporary Femme Fatale: Gender, Genre and American Cinema, Katherine Farrimond shows how the femme fatale - primarily associated with the classic film noirs of the 1940s and 1950s – remains a remarkably resilient and malleable figure in the present, tracing her appearance across a variety of genres in contemporary US cinema. This is a well-argued, convincing study, writes Fiona Handyside, with a reading of the femme fatale that demonstrates her capacity to pose vital and complex questions about the representation of women’s agency, sexuality and desire in the current cultural landscape Die Femme fatale ist ein komplexes Thema, welches in dieser Arbeit versucht wurde fassbar zu machen. Der Mythos um die verderbenbringende Frau ist nicht neu und ist auch heute noch aktuell. Es wurde ein Panoptikum von den Anfängen am Beispiel des Mythos um die Amazonen und Wasserfrauen, über die Verwissenschaftlichung zur Jahrhundertwende, bis hin zur weiblichen Darstellungskunst anhand der Schauspielerinnen Sarah Bernhardt, Greta Garbo und Marlene Dietrich und dem Filmgenre noir/neo-noir erstellt, um letztlich anhand der Seifenoper GZSZ und der Telenovela Verliebt in Berlin, die Aktualität der Femme fatale aufzuzeigen	['74338061', '132266524', '8580962', '154831752', '9127663', '67198275', '57724339', '18711240', '4929077']	[[{'name': 'Barnes-Smith, Danielle L'}], [{'name': 'Dyer, Briyana'}], [{'name': 'Murphy, Ian Robert'}], [{'name': "D'AGOSTINI, ALESSIA"}], [{'name': 'Dennon, Anne'}], [{'name': 'Stuart, Esther M'}], [{'name': 'Barić, Tea'}], [{'name': 'Handyside, Fiona'}], [{'name': 'Strohmaier, Alena'}]]	['Fatal Woman, Revisited: Understanding Female Stereotypes in Film Noir', '"Women Who Get Away With It”: contemporary femme fatales under the patriarchy', 'Art, Androgyny, and the Femme Fatale in Decadent Fictions of the Nineteenth Century', 'Femmes Fatales as Mythological Creatures in Romantic and Victorian Poetry', 'The Emergence of the Feminist Fatale in American Film Noir', 'Femme Fatales and the Shifting Gender Norms of the 19th Century', 'Lik fatalne žene u književnosti i filmu: feministički fenomen ili seksualni objekt?', 'Book review: the contemporary femme fatale: gender, genre and American cinema by Katherine Farrimond', 'Mythos Femme fatale']	exploratory	9

Many people believe chess has a range of cognitive benefits including improved memory, IQ, problem solving  skills and concentration.    But there is very little evidence supporting these conclusions. We conducted two studies (still unpublished) that found educators and parents believe chess has many  educational benefits. But children in our study who played chess did not show significant improvements in standardised test scores compared to children who didn’t play Although the game of chess has often featured in psychological research, we know very little about people who play chess, especially about children who take up chess as a hobby. This study presents the personality profiles as measured with the Big Five model (BFQ-C; Barbaranelli et al., 2003) of 219 young children who play chess and 50 of their peers who do not. Children who score higher on Intellect/openness and Energy/extraversion are more likely to play chess while children who score higher on Agreeableness are less likely to be attracted to chess. Boys with higher scores on Agreeableness are less likely to take up chess than boys with lower scores. Considering that girls score higher on Agreeableness, this factor may provide one of the possible reasons why more boys are interested in chess. Although none of the Big Five factors were associated with self-reported skill level, a sub-sample of 25 elite players had significantly higher scores on Intellect/openness than their weaker chess playing peers Eugene Nalimov has completed the computation of a set of endgame tables for 6-man chess, and independently, Marc Bourzutschky has completed tables for 3-3 chess and for 4-2 chess where Black is not just ‘KP’. The ICGA salutes both achievements and looks ahead This is a review of progress in the Chess Endgame field. It includes news of the promulgation of Endgame Tables, their use, non-use and potential runtime creation. It includes news of data-mining achievements related to 7-man chess and to the field of Chess Studies. It includes news of an algorithm to create Endgame Tables for variants of the normal game of chess Although it is widely acknowledged that chess is the best example of an intellectual activity among games, evidence showing the association between any kind of intellectual ability and chess skill has been remarkably sparse. One of the reasons is that most of the studies investigated only one factor (e.g., intelligence), neglecting other factors relevant for the acquisition of chess skill (e.g., amount of practice, years of experience). The present study investigated the chess skill of 57 young chess players using measures of intelligence (WISC III), practice, and experience. Although practice had the most influence on chess skill, intelligence explained some variance even after the inclusion of practice. When an elite subsample of 23 children was tested, it turned out that intelligence was not a significant factor in chess skill, and that, if anything, it tended to correlate negatively with chess skill. This unexpected result is explained by a negative correlation between intelligence and practice in the elite subsample. The study demonstrates the dangers of focusing on a single factor in complex real-world situations where a number of closely interconnected factors operate The 'WCSC 2019' World Chess Software Championship was the ICGA's ninth experimental test of computer chess software in a neutral hardware environment. Held in Macau, this event was won by KOMODO with JONNY and CHIRON scarcely separable in second and third Some 50,000 Win Studies in Chess challenge White to find an effectively unique route to a win. Judging the impact of less than absolute uniqueness requires both technical analysis and artistic judgment. Here, for the first time, an algorithm is defined to help analyse uniqueness in endgame positions objectively. The key idea is to examine how critical certain positions are to White in achieving the win. The algorithm uses sub-n-man endgame tables  (EGTs) for both Chess and relevant, adjacent variants of Chess. It challenges authors of EGT generators to generalise them to create EGTs for these chess variants.  It has already proved efficient and effective in an implementation for Starchess, itself a variant of chess. The approach also addresses a number of similar questions arising in endgame theory, games and compositions The extent to which the acquisition of expertise in knowledge-rich domains, such as chess, can be influenced by general individual characteristics, such as intelligence, has remained unclear. Some previous studies with children have documented significant correlations between chess skill and performance on some psychometric tests, such as performance IQ (Frydman & Lynn, 1992). However, we found no evidence for a correlation between chess skill and visual memory ability in a group of adult chess players (n=36, age = 28.4). This finding, together with other data in the literature, suggests that there is surprisingly little evidence that chess skill and visuo-spatial ability are associated in adults.  Thus, visual memory ability, and perhaps visuo-spatial intelligence, may be relatively unimportant factors in the long-term acquisition of chess skill	['23053347', '344862', '216434', '214802', '344875', '8257960', '268247', '344012']	[[{'name': 'Gardiner, Graeme'}, {'name': 'Ormsby, Gail'}, {'name': 'van der Laan, Luke'}], [{'name': 'Ablow'}, {'name': 'Austin'}, {'name': 'Avni'}, {'name': 'Barbaranelli'}, {'name': 'Bilalić'}, {'name': 'Charness'}, {'name': 'Costa'}, {'name': 'Costa'}, {'name': 'Fernand Gobet'}, {'name': 'Frydman'}, {'name': 'Gobet'}, {'name': 'Goodwin'}, {'name': 'Harris'}, {'name': 'Horgan'}, {'name': 'Howard'}, {'name': 'Joireman'}, {'name': 'Kelly'}, {'name': 'Marsh'}, {'name': 'Mazur'}, {'name': 'Mazur'}, {'name': 'Measelle'}, {'name': 'Merim Bilalić'}, {'name': 'Muris'}, {'name': 'Peter McLeod'}, {'name': 'Rubinstein'}, {'name': 'Shiner'}, {'name': 'Simon'}], [{'name': 'Haworth, Guy McCrossan'}], [{'name': 'Haworth, Guy McCrossan'}], [{'name': 'Aagaard'}, {'name': 'Ackerman'}, {'name': 'Binet'}, {'name': 'Campitelli'}, {'name': 'Charness'}, {'name': 'Charness'}, {'name': 'Chase'}, {'name': 'Chase'}, {'name': 'Cohen'}, {'name': 'Cranberg'}, {'name': 'de Groot'}, {'name': 'de Groot'}, {'name': 'Detterman'}, {'name': 'Detterman'}, {'name': 'Djakow'}, {'name': 'Doll'}, {'name': 'Ericsson'}, {'name': 'Ericsson'}, {'name': 'Ericsson'}, {'name': 'Ericsson'}, {'name': 'Fernand Gobet'}, {'name': 'Fine'}, {'name': 'Fox'}, {'name': 'Frydman'}, {'name': 'Gagné'}, {'name': 'Gobet'}, {'name': 'Gobet'}, {'name': 'Gobet'}, {'name': 'Gobet'}, {'name': 'Gobet'}, {'name': 'Gobet'}, {'name': 'Grabner'}, {'name': 'Gruber'}, {'name': 'Guilford'}, {'name': 'Holding'}, {'name': 'Holding'}, {'name': 'Horgan'}, {'name': 'Howard'}, {'name': 'Howard'}, {'name': 'Howard'}, {'name': 'Howard'}, {'name': 'Howe'}, {'name': 'Irwing'}, {'name': 'Kaufman'}, {'name': 'Merim Bilalić'}, {'name': 'Neisser'}, {'name': 'Newell'}, {'name': 'Opwis'}, {'name': 'Peter McLeod'}, {'name': 'Saariluoma'}, {'name': 'Sattler'}, {'name': 'Sattler'}, {'name': 'Schmidt'}, {'name': 'Schmidt'}, {'name': 'Shepard'}, {'name': 'Simon'}, {'name': 'Sternberg'}, {'name': 'Unterrainer'}, {'name': 'Vicente'}, {'name': 'Ward'}, {'name': 'Waters'}], [{'name': 'Haworth, Guy'}, {'name': 'Krabbenbos, Jan'}, {'name': 'van den Herik, Jaap'}], [{'name': 'Haworth, Guy'}, {'name': 'Rusz, Arpad'}], [{'name': 'Gobet, F'}, {'name': 'Leyden, G'}, {'name': 'Waters, A'}]]	['Most people think playing chess makes you ‘smarter’, but the evidence isn’t clear on that', 'Personality profiles of young chess players', '6-man chess solved', 'Chess endgame update', 'Does chess need intelligence? – A study with young chess players', 'WCSC 2019: the 9th World Chess Software Championship', 'Position criticality in chess endgames', 'Visuo-spatial abilities in chess players']	exploratory	8

Analytical techniques include electron microprobe, INAA, and ICP-MS Describes the release of soluble metal ions from copper based dental alloys mesured by ICP-MS. Presented at the annual congress of the british toxicology society This dissertation describes a variety of studies meant to improve the analytical performance of inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) and laser ablation (LA) ICP-MS. The emission behavior of individual droplets and LA generated particles in an ICP is studied using a high-speed, high frame rate digital camera. Phenomena are observed during the ablation of silicate glass that would cause elemental fractionation during analysis by ICP-MS. Preliminary work for ICP torch developments specifically tailored for the improvement of LA sample introduction are presented. An abnormal scarcity of metal-argon polyatomic ions (MAr+) is observed during ICP-MS analysis. Evidence shows that MAr+ ions are dissociated by collisions with background gas in a shockwave near the tip of the skimmer cone. Method development towards the improvement of LA-ICP-MS for environmental monitoring is described. A method is developed to trap small particles in a collodion matrix and analyze each particle individually by LA-ICP-MS International audienceThe aim of our research was to compare delta B-11 measurements performed with thermal ionization mass spectrometry (TIMS) and sector field-inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry (SF-ICP-MS) and evaluate the feasibility of implementing stable isotope methods in European water framework directive (WFD) monitoring programs. The comparison was based on delta B-11 measurements of 192 ground-and surface water samples and 15 leachates of nitrate pollution source materials (organic and mineral fertilisers). The precision of delta B-11 measurements attainable with SF-ICP-MS, 2 sigma= +/- 2.6 parts per thousand; (n = 192), is as expected lower than the precision achieved by TIMS, 2 sigma= +/- 0.3 parts per thousand (n=183). However the ease of use, rapidity and availability of SF-ICP-MS on one hand and the observed variability in delta B-11 in ground-and surface water on the other (from -3.4 to +37 parts per thousand), demonstrates that using SF-ICP-MS as an isotopic screening method would promote the use of isotopic methodology for WFD monitoring. Based on the results of the different case studies it is shown that retrieving precise information on the identification of pollution sources from delta B-11 values requires reaching the best analytical precision and accuracy possible. Hence, the superior precision of TIMS advantages tracing of nitrate pollution sources. However for some cases, e. g. trying to decipher contributions between sources with really distinct delta B-11 signatures (e.g. manure and sewage effluent), SF-ICP-MS results lead to the same conclusions and can therefore be used as a first approachable screening method for the determination of delta B-11 in WFD monitoring programs The applicability of laser ablation multi-collector inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry (LA-MC-ICP-MS) for the determination of the B isotopic composition in Roman glasses was investigated. The delta B-11 values thus obtained provide information on the natron flux used during the glass-making process. The glass samples used for this purpose were previously characterized using pneumatic nebulization (PN) MC-ICP-MS. Unfortunately, this method is time-consuming and labor-intensive and consumes some 100 mg of sample, which is a rather high amount for ancient materials. Therefore, the use of the less invasive and faster LA-MC-ICP-MS approach was explored. In this work, the results for 29 Roman glasses and 4 home-made glasses obtained using both techniques were compared to assess the suitability of LA-MC-ICP-MS in this context. The results are in excellent agreement within experimental uncertainty. No difference in overall mass discrimination was observed between the Roman glasses, NIST SRM 610 reference glass and B6 obsidian. The expanded uncertainty of the LA-MC-ICP-MS approach was estimated to be <2%., which is similar to that obtained upon sample digestion and PN-MC-ICP-MS measurement Atomic spectroscopy based analytical techniques can generate fingerprints encompassing the vast majority of elements found in the periodic table as well as ratios of their stable isotopes.   These highly multivariate fingerprints have laid the foundation of many recent studies within environmental, geological, agricultural and food science. Inductively coupled plasma-optical emission spectroscopy (ICP-OES) and ICP-mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) still dominate multi-elemental analyses of biological samples while stable isotopes of the light mass elements H, C, N, O and S are measured by isotope ratio-mass spectrometry (IR-MS). However, it has recently been shown that rather unexplored analytical methods such as semi-quantitative ICP-MS and compound-specific isotope analysis (CSIA) can generate novel information suitable for evaluating the authenticity of plant based food products (1-3).   Most plant based studies using atomic spectroscopy have focused on the essential nutrients: B, Mg, P, S, K, Ca, Mn, Fe, Ni, Cu, Zn, Mo and selected heavy metals such as Cd and Pb (4). However, plants contain traces of most of the periodic table, which can be measured by semi-quantitative ICP-MS (1-2). This represents a fast method for elemental fingerprinting in the mass range 7Li to 238U, but the accuracy suffers from the simplified calibration procedure that this technique is based on. The combination of semi-quantitative ICP-MS and multivariate statistics (chemometrics) efficiently minimize this problem and constitute a promising tool for authentication of plant products according to their geographical origin and production form (2).   Stable isotope analysis complements elemental fingerprinting by targeting specific biological processes and their impact on the isotopic plant composition. This has recently proven valuable for authenticating organically grown plant products – especially when focusing on selected isotope pairs in plant derived compounds such as 18O/16O in NO3- using CSIA (3). Cases of novel atomic spectroscopy based food authentications will be presented at the conference Extractions methods based on ultrapure water, tetramethylammonium hydroxide (TMAH), and tetrasodium pyrophosphate (TSPP) were applied to faeces collected from two in vivo experiments of pigs and chickens fed with a silver-based nanomaterial to study the fate and speciation of silver. For TMAH extraction, cysteine and CaCl2 were used to evaluate their stabilization effect on the silver forms. The analytical techniques single-particle inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (SP-ICP-MS), hydrodynamic chromatography hyphenated to ICP-MS (HDC-ICP-MS) and asymmetric flow field flow fractionation coupled to ICP-MS (AF4-ICP-MS) were applied to the simultaneous detection of particulate and dissolved silver. Results have shown that water extraction was a suitable option to assess the environmental release of silver, with percentages of 3 and 9% for faeces of pigs and chickens, respectively. The use of TMAH extraction combined with SP-ICP-MS analysis was useful to characterize Ag-containing particles (less than 1%). Both stabilizers, cysteine and CaCl2, have a similar effect on silver nanoparticle preservation for chicken faeces, whereas cysteine-Triton was better for pig samples. In any case, silver extraction efficiency with TMAH was low (39–42%) for both types of faeces due to a matrix effect. TSPP followed by ICP-MS enabled the fractionation of the silver in the faeces, with silver sulphide (41%) and ionic silver (62%) being the most abundant fractions Meghatároztuk a Nagyhörcsöki Nehézfém Terheléses Kísérlet növény- (kukorica, sárgarépa, borsó, őszi búza) és talajmintái (az As, Cd, Mo, Pb és Se elemekkel kezelt parcellák) elemtartalmát.

b44d33d1-88d6-47ec-ae67-256c0b37944c	report	Spinning small silicate grains were recently invoked to account for the Galactic foreground anomalous microwave emission. These grains, if present, will absorb starlight in the far ultraviolet (UV). There is also renewed interest in attributing the enigmatic 2175 Angstrom interstellar extinction bump to small silicates. To probe the role of silicon in the UV extinction, we explore the relations between the amount of silicon required to be locked up in silicates [Si/H]_{dust} and the 2175 Angstrom bump or the far-UV extinction rise, based on an analysis of the extinction curves along 46 Galactic sightlines for which the gas-phase silicon abundance [Si/H]_{gas} is known. We derive [Si/H]_{dust} either from {[Si/H]_{ISM} - [Si/H]_{gas}} or from the Kramers-Kronig relation which relates the wavelength-integrated extinction to the total dust volume, where [Si/H]_{ISM} is the interstellar silicon reference abundance and taken to be that of proto-Sun or B stars. We also derive [Si/H]_{dust} from fitting the observed extinction curves with a mixture of amorphous silicates and graphitic grains. We find that in all three cases [Si/H]_{dust} shows no correlation with the 2175 Angstrom bump, while the carbon depletion [C/H]_{dust} tends to correlate with the 2175 Angstrom bump. This supports carbon grains instead of silicates as the possible carrier of the 2175 Angstrom bump. We also find that neither [Si/H]_{dust} nor [C/H]_{dust} alone correlates with the far-UV extinction, suggesting that the far-UV extinction is a combined effect of small carbon grains and silicates.Comment: 38 pages, 15 figures, 2 tables; accepted for publication in The   Astrophysical Journal (2017). arXiv admin note: text overlap with   arXiv:1507.0659 The 10-year drug strategy for England and Wales was published in February 2008. It dropped drugs-related deaths (DRDs) as a key performance indicator. Scotland retained a necessary strong focus on DRDs. Scotland's DRDs numbered 1006 in 2000–02 and 1009 in 2003–05. The previous Scottish administration's claim that its number of current injectors had decreased substantially between 2000 and 2003 implied, paradoxically, that their DRD rate would have to have increased. Worse was to come: Scotland's DRDs had increased to 876 in 2006 + 2007. We analyse UK's DRDs by sex and age-group to reveal temporal trends (2000–02 versus 2003–05 versus 2006 + 2007) with different public health and epidemiological implications. We also address the above Scottish paradox and assess, by age-group, how consistent Scotland's 876 DRDs in 2006 + 2007 are with Scottish injectors’ DRD rate in 2003–05 of around 1 per 100 injector-years. Public health success in the UK in reducing DRDs at younger ages should not be overshadowed by the late consequence in terms of older-age DRDs of UK's injector epidemics; in the early 1980s in Scotland, and late 1980s in England and Wales.

b4869eae-7313-4aa3-a533-51dcaa7e34e0	natural rate	OECD unemployment rates show long swings which dominate shorter business cycle components and  these long swings show a range of common patterns. Using a panel of 21 OECD countries 1960-2002,  we estimate the common factor that drives unemployment by the first principal component. This factor  has a natural interpretation as a measure of global expected returns, which is given added plausibility  by the fact that it is almost identical to the common factor driving investment shares. We estimate a  model of unemployment adjustment, which allows for the influence both of the global factor and of  labour market institutions and we examine whether the global factor can act as a proxy for the natural  rate in a Phillips Curve. In 15 out of the 21 countries one cannot reject that the same natural rate, as a  function of the global factor, appears in both the unemployment and inflation equations. In explaining  both unemployment and inflation, the global factor is highly significant, suggesting that models which  ignore the global dimension are likely to be deficient The uniqueness of bounded local equilibria under interest rate rules is analyzed in a model with sticky information `a la Mankiw and Reis (2002). The main results are tighter bounds on monetary policy than in sticky-price models, irrelevance of the degree of output-gap targeting for determinacy, independence of determinacy regions from parameters outside the interest-rate rule, and equivalence between real determinacy in models satisfying the natural rate hypothesis and nominal determinacy in the associated full-information, flex-price equivalent. The analysis follows from boundedness considerations on the nonautonomous recursion that describe the MA(¥) representation of variables’ reaction to endogenous fluctuations.Nonautonomous difference equations; Indeterminacy; Taylor rule; Sticky information; Sticky prices By most estimates, the U.S. unemployment rate is currently below its "natural rate." The implication is the economy is operating at an unsustainably high level of resource utilization. Capacity levels are being strained, tending to put upward pressure on wages and prices. In anticipation of these rising inflationary pressures, the Federal Reserve has firmed monetary policy several times over the past year.> A majority of mainstream economists appear comfortable with the natural rate framework, in part because it has tracked inflation successfully over the past 35 years. Despite its excellent record, however, the natural rate framework has not been without critics. In the past year, nonbelievers have advanced a number of arguments for why mounting inflationary pressures should not be a concern at this time. These arguments have focused on the heightened globalization of the marketplace, the weak bargaining position of the labor force, widespread productivity gains, and the absence to date of an unambiguous rise in inflation.> In this article, adapted from presentations made to the National Economists Club and the Congressional Budget Office in February 1995, Weiner considers the arguments against the natural rate framework. He offers some counterarguments and concludes that concerns about future inflationary pressures are well founded.Inflation (Finance) ; Unemployment An optimizing model of a small open emerging market economy (SOEME) with dualistic labour markets and two types of consumers, is used to derive the natural interest rate, terms of trade and potential output. Shocks are classified into generic types that affect the natural interest rates. Since parameters depend on features of the labour market and on consumption inequality, the natural rates and the impact of shocks differ from those in a mature small open economy. Subsistence consumption is found to have the largest effect on the natural rates. It reduces the interest rate, raises natural output and the terms of trade. Technology and infrastructure backwardness reduce natural output. The implications for monetary policy are derived. The effect of managed exchange rates combined with different types of inflation targeting is examined through simulations. Endogenous terms of trade make the supply curve steeper in a SOEME, so partial stickiness of the real exchange rate can be beneficial. In general, domestic inflation targeting, with some weight on the output gap, delivers lower volatility. Output response is higher and volatility lower with fixed terms of trade, demonstrating the flatter supply curve. CPI inflation targeting also does well when terms of trade are credibly fixed.small open emerging market, optimal monetary policy, dualistic labour markets, natural interest rates, terms of trade, natural output In classical evolutionary theory, genetic variation provides the source of heritable phenotypic variation on which natural selection acts. Against this classical view, several theories have emphasized that developmental variability and learning enhance nonheritable phenotypic variation, which in turn can accelerate evolutionary response. In this paper, I show how developmental variability alters evolutionary dynamics by smoothing the landscape that relates genotype to fitness. In a fitness landscape with multiple peaks and valleys, developmental variability can smooth the landscape to provide a directly increasing path of fitness to the highest peak. Developmental variability also allows initial survival of a genotype in response to novel or extreme environmental challenge, providing an opportunity for subsequent adaptation. This initial survival advantage arises from the way in which developmental variability smooths and broadens the fitness landscape. Ultimately, the synergism between developmental processes and genetic variation sets evolutionary rate This study uses 1989-2005 data for the Seattle metropolitan area to test the natural vacancy rate hypothesis for rental housing markets using a new methodology. Findings support the existence of a natural vacancy rate for apartments that varies over time, and in some cases across apartment submarkets. Results show a decline in the natural vacancy rate in the time period following the introduction and growth of the Web. Results also show significant differences in natural vacancy rates for different geographic subareas. No significant differences in the natural vacancy rate are found for different apartment types. CRS_March_2004_Changing_Natural_Rate_of_Unemployment.pdf: 4154 downloads, before Oct. 1, 2020 Studies in the economics of crime literature have reached mixed conclusions on the deterrence hypothesis. One explanation which has been offered for the failure to find evidence of a deterrent effect in the long run is the natural rate of crime. This paper applies the univariate Lagrange Multiplier (LM) unit root test with one and two structural breaks to crime series for the United Kingdom and United States and the panel LM unit root test with and without a structural break to crime rates for a panel of G7 countries to examine whether there is a natural rate of crime. Our main finding is that when we allow for two structural breaks in the LM unit root test and a structural break in the panel data unit root test, there is strong evidence of a natural rate of crime. The policy implications of our findings is that governments should focus on altering the economic and social structural profile which determines crime in the long run rather than increasing expenditure on law enforcement which will at best reduce crime rates in the short run.Natural rate of crime; Deterrence hypothesis; unit root. I propose an econometric model that improves upon existing methods of estimating the natural rate of unemployment (NAIRU) by using information contained in the trend of productivity growth. My approach enhances the recently proposed model of Staiger, Stock and Watson (1997) in several respects. Statistically speaking, the method substantially shrinks the width of the 95% confidence interval, performs better in an out-of-sample inflation forecasting exercise, and is more robust to alternativestatistical assumptions. In economic terms, the productivity-augmented model generates a more realistic time profile of the NAIRU, and implies estimates of the Phillipscurve slope and the sacrifice ratio that are more in line with conventional wisdom. I also test whether the natural rate is correlated with the level or with the change of the productivity growth trend. I find support for the "level" hypothesis in both the US and international data.Natural rate of unemployment; Productivity; Phillips curve; Time-varying parameters; Kalman filter	['214202', '2896916', '2795750', '2688435', '780489', '2864508', '2351780', '2487369', '2500601']	[[{'name': 'Smith, Ron P.'}, {'name': 'Zoega, Gylfi'}], [{'name': 'Alexander Meyer-Gohde'}], [{'name': 'Stuart E.

b5239e03-6248-4fcb-bbf6-651a8a1423f2	reactivity	Numerous reactive volatile organic compounds (VOCs) are emitted into the atmosphere by vegetation. Most biogenic VOCs are highly reactive towards the atmosphere's most important oxidant, the hydroxyl (OH) radical. One way to investigate the chemical interplay between biosphere and atmosphere is through the measurement of total OH reactivity, the total loss rate of OH radicals. This study presents the first determination of total OH reactivity emission rates (measurements via the Comparative Reactivity Method) based on a branch cuvette enclosure system mounted on a Norway spruce (Picea abies) throughout spring, summer and autumn 2011. In parallel separate VOC emission rates were monitored by a Proton Transfer Reaction-Mass Spectrometer (PTR-MS), and total ozone (O3) loss rates were obtained inside the cuvette. Total OH reactivity emission rates were in general temperature and light dependent, showing strong diel cycles with highest values during daytime. Monoterpene emissions contributed most, accounting for 56–69% of the measured total OH reactivity flux in spring and early summer. However, during late summer and autumn the monoterpene contribution decreased to 11–16%. At this time, a large missing fraction of the total OH reactivity emission rate (70–84%) was found when compared to the VOC budget measured by PTR-MS. Total OH reactivity and missing total OH reactivity emission rates reached maximum values in late summer corresponding to the period of highest temperature. Total O3 loss rates within the closed cuvette showed similar diel profiles and comparable seasonality to the total OH reactivity fluxes.   Total OH reactivity fluxes were also compared to emissions from needle storage pools predicted by a temperature-only dependent algorithm. Deviations of total OH reactivity fluxes from the temperature-only dependent emission algorithm were observed for occasions of mechanical and heat stress. While for mechanical stress, induced by strong wind, measured VOCs could explain total OH reactivity emissions, during heat stress they could not. The temperature driven algorithm matched the diel course much better in spring than in summer, indicating a different production and emission scheme for summer and early autumn. During these times, unmeasured and possibly unknown primary biogenic emissions contributed significantly to the observed total OH reactivity flux The reactivity hypothesis implicates exaggerated cardiovascular reactions to acute psychological stress in the development of hypertension and other cardiovascular disease outcomes.  However, cardiovascular reactivity has also been suggested as a mediator between a variety of psychosocial and behavioural risk factors and cardiovascular disease.  Data from various analyses of the West of Scotland Twenty-07 study are discussed together, and caution against over-stretching the original reactivity hypothesis.  Blood pressure and heart rate were assessed at rest and during an acute mental arithmetic stress task.  First, depression, though a putative risk factor for cardiovascular disease, does not appear to confer this risk via exaggerated reactivity, as it was negatively related to reactivity.  Second, obesity, another risk factor, was also associated with blunted rather than heightened reactivity.  Finally, lower reactivity was related to poorer self-reported health.  Similar associations emerged from both cross-sectional and prospective analyses.  These seemingly paradoxical results are discussed in terms of implications for the reactivity hypothesis Numerous reactive volatile organic compounds (VOCs) are emitted into the atmosphere by vegetation.

During these times, unmeasured and possibly unknown primary biogenic emissions contributed significantly to the observed total OH reactivity flux Callous-unemotional (CU) traits are thought to confer risk for aggression via reduced amygdala responsivity to distress cues in others. Low cortisol reactivity is thought to confer risk for aggression via reduced arousal and this effect may be confined to boys. We tested the hypothesis that the association between childhood CU traits and aggression would be greatest in the absence of the inhibitory effects of cortisol reactivity, and that this effect would be sex dependent. Participants were 283 members of a stratified subsample within an epidemiological longitudinal cohort (WCHADS). Cortisol reactivity to a social stressor was assessed at 5 years. CU traits were reported by mothers at 5 years, and physical aggression by mothers and teachers at age 7. Results showed that CU traits were associated with elevated aggression at 7 years controlling for earlier aggression. There was no main effect of cortisol reactivity on regression. The association between CU traits and aggression was moderated by cortisol reactivity (p = .011) with a strong association between CU traits and aggression in the presence of low reactivity, and a small and non-significant association in the presence of high reactivity. This association was further moderated by child sex (p = .041) with the joint effect of high CU traits and low cortisol reactivity seen only in boys (p = .016). We report first evidence that a combined deficit in inhibitory processes associated with CU traits and low cortisol reactivity increases risk for childhood aggression, in a sex-dependent manner The reaction of several plant chlorophyll-protein complexes with NaBH4 has been studied by absorption spectroscopy. In all the complexes studied, chlorophyll b is more reactive than Chi a, due to preferential reaction of its formyl substituent at C-7. The complexes also show large variations in reactivity towards NaBH4 and the order of reactivity is: LHCI > PSII complex > LHCII > PSI > P700 (investigated as a component of PSI). Differential pools of the same type of chlorophyll have been observed in several complexes.  Parallel work was undertaken on the reactivity of micellar complexes of chlorophyll a and of chlorophyll b with NaBH4 to study the effect of aggregation state on this reactivity. In these complexes, both chlorophyll a and b show large variations in reactivity in the order monomer > oligomer > polymer with chlorophyll b generally being more reactive than chlorophyll a. It is concluded that aggregation decreases the reactivity of chlorophylls towards NaBH4 in vitro, and may similarly decrease reactivity in naturally-occurring chlorophyll-protein complexes Frontotemporal dementia (FTD), a neurodegenerative disease broadly characterized by socioemotional impairments, includes three clinical subtypes: behavioral variant FTD (bvFTD), semantic variant primary progressive aphasia (svPPA) and non-fluent variant primary progressive aphasia (nfvPPA). Emerging evidence has shown emotional reactivity impairments in bvFTD and svPPA, whereas emotional reactivity in nfvPPA is far less studied. In 105 patients with FTD (49 bvFTD, 31 svPPA and 25 nfvPPA) and 27 healthy controls, we examined three aspects of emotional reactivity (physiology, facial behavior and subjective experience) in response to a sad film. In a subset of the sample, we also examined the neural correlates of diminished aspects of reactivity using voxel-based morphometry. Results indicated that all three subtypes of FTD showed diminished physiological responding in respiration rate and diastolic blood pressure; patients with bvFTD and svPPA also showed diminished subjective experience, and no subtypes showed diminished facial behavior. Moreover, there were differences among the clinical subtypes in brain regions where smaller volumes were associated with diminished sadness reactivity. These results show that emotion impairments extend to sadness reactivity in FTD and underscore the importance of considering different aspects of sadness reactivity in multiple clinical subtypes for characterizing emotional deficits and associated neurodegeneration in FTD Indexación: Web of ScienceTheoretical reactivity indices based on the conceptual Density Functional Theory (DFT) have become a powerful tool for the semiquantitative study of organic reactivity. A large number of reactivity indices have been proposed in the literature. Herein, global quantities like the electronic chemical potential μ, the electrophilicity ω and the nucleophilicity N indices, and local condensed indices like the electrophilic   and nucleophilic   Parr functions, as the most relevant indices for the study of organic reactivity, are discussed.http://www.mdpi.com/1420-3049/21/6/74 To evaluate reactivity to assess the temperament of Nellore steers in two feedlot housing systems (group pen or individual pen) and its relationship with plasmatic cortisol, 36 experimental units were observed five times at 28-day intervals of weight management during a 112-day feedlot confinement. A reactivity score scale ranging from 1 to 5 was applied when an animal was in the chute system. To the calmest animal, a reactivity score of 1 was ascribed and to the most agitated, 5. Blood samples were collected for cortisol analysis. No differences were found in reactivity and feedlot system. There was a relationship noted between reactivity and feedlot time in both housing systems (Pb0.01). There was a relation between reactivity and cortisol levels for group animals (P=0.0616) and for individual ones (Pb0.01). Cortisol levels varied among housing systems (Pb0.01). Feedlot time influenced the cortisol levels (Pb0.09 individual; Pb0.01 group) and when variable time was included, these levels changed, decreasing in the group pen and increasing in individual pens. The continuous handling reduces reactivity and plasmatic cortisol, and group pen system seems to be less stressfully than individual pens	['36389913', '4291298', '6721095', '8257487', '5225160', '85867447', '46771460', '34115001']	[[{'name': 'Bonn, Boris'}, {'name': 'Bourtsoukidis, Efstratios'}, {'name': 'Kesselmeier, Jürgen'}, {'name': 'Lelieveld, Johannes'}, {'name': 'Nölscher, Anke Christine'}, {'name': 'Williams, Jonathan'}], [{'name': 'Phillips, Anna C.'}], [{'name': 'Bonn, Boris'}, {'name': 'Bourtsoukidis, Efstratios'}, {'name': 'Kesselmeier, Jürgen'}, {'name': 'Lelieveld, Johannes'}, {'name': 'Nölscher, Anke Christine'}, {'name': 'Williams, Jonathan'}], [{'name': 'A Dietrich'}, {'name': 'A Raine'}, {'name': 'A Steptoe'}, {'name': 'C Moul'}, {'name': 'CJ Patrick'}, {'name': 'CK Conners'}, {'name': 'CS Barrios'}, {'name': 'CT Barry'}, {'name': 'DJ Hawes'}, {'name': 'ER Kimonis'}, {'name': 'H Sharp'}, {'name': 'I Ouellet-Morin'}, {'name': 'JB Hinnant'}, {'name': 'JB Hinnant'}, {'name': 'KJ Koss'}, {'name': 'KL Salis'}, {'name': 'L Poustka'}, {'name': 'LK Muthén'}, {'name': 'LRA Alink'}, {'name': 'LW Hyde'}, {'name': 'M El-Sheikh'}, {'name': 'M El-Sheikh'}, {'name': 'M Zuckerman'}, {'name': 'MH Meier'}, {'name': 'MR Dadds'}, {'name': 'MR Dadds'}, {'name': 'MR Dadds'}, {'name': 'MR Gunnar'}, {'name': 'MT Willoughby'}, {'name': 'N Wright'}, {'name': 'NM Fontaine'}, {'name': 'P Vidal-Ribas'}, {'name': 'PJ Frick'}, {'name': 'PJ Frick'}, {'name': 'PJ Frick'}, {'name': 'PJ Frick'}, {'name': 'R Goodman'}, {'name': 'R Marsman'}, {'name': 'R Waller'}, {'name': 'R Waller'}, {'name': 'R Young'}, {'name': 'RH Baillargeon'}, {'name': 'RJ Blair'}, {'name': 'RJ Blair'}, {'name': 'RJ Blair'}, {'name': 'RJR Blair'}, {'name': 'S Morales'}, {'name': 'S Moriceau'}, {'name': 'SD Pollak'}, {'name': 'SE Taylor'}, {'name': 'SH Goozen Van'}, {'name': 'StataCorp.'}, {'name': 'TE Moffitt'}, {'name': 'TM Achenbach'}], [{'name': 'Arnon D.

b8c83d89-c205-4288-9dd2-b2e46973e2f9	spawning	This is the first annual report of the status of the spawning population of the Pacific mackerel as required by Section 8388.3 of the Fish and Game Code.  During 1972 and early 1973, several methods of determining population size were investigated as mechanisms for estimating the spawning population size of Pacific mackerel stocks north of Punta Eugenia, Baja California,  and a method using tagging procedures proved to be the most acceptable. The estimate of the Pacific mackerel spawning population obtained by tagging procedures was 5,480 tons. This estimate agrees generally with those obtained  from alternate methods in which previously computed spawning biomass estimates were correlated with partyboat catches in three different areas and the 1973 spawning biomass estimated from the resulting regression line. The estimates  derived by these alternate methods are 6,970 tons, 4,730 tons, and 6,210 tons.  All estimates are below the 10,000 ton spawning population minimum and thus there is no excess by which a harvest under Section 8388.5 of the Fish and Game Code could be allowed. (17pp. Baltic cod spawning takes place in the deep basins and reproduction success is mainly  related to environmental conditions (salinity and oxygen regimes, i.e. the 'reproduction volume'). Due to the Baltic Sea heterogeneity, cod reproduction success in the Southem and Centrat Baltic spawning grounds can differ significantly. Recent oceanographic changes i.e. decrease of water exchange and stagnation, as weil as a strong reduction of spawning stock caused the diminishing of the reproduction  potential of the Gotland spawning grounds. The Gotland spawning grounds belong to four main cod spawning sites in the Baltic and historical analyses revealed that abundant generations of Baltic cod were produced when successful cod reproduction took place also in the Gotland Basin.  Analyses of revised reproduction volume estimates for the Gotland Basin taking into  account the spatial structure of hydrology in the basin during stagnation and aeration  periods reveals high seasonal and inter-annual variability. To describe changes of abundance and distribution of the spawning stock and the recruits in relation to hydrographic conditions, results from trawl surveys carried out in 1975-1998 in the Gotland Deep are analyzed. In this analysis, the reproduction volume is used as a proxy for the environmental conditions The 1987-88 spawning biomass estimate of Pacific herring,  Clupea harengus pallasi, in San Francisco Bay is nearly  69,000 tons. This is the fourth consecutive year that the  San Francisco Bay population has increased, after reaching a  low point of 40,000 tons in 1984.  In Tomales Bay the 1987-88 herring spawning biomass was  estimated at 2,061 tons. During the past five seasons, the  Tomales Bay spawning biomass has been low in even years and  high in odd years, indicating that spawning herring are not  returning to Tomales Bay consistently.  In San Francisco Bay, over 42,000 tons of herring spawned in  January. Similarly, 90% of Tomales Bay herring spawned in  January. No spawns were found during March in either bay.  For the first time, in San Francisco Bay, no herring spawned  in the Belvedere, Tiburon, or Angel Island areas. In  addition, herring spawning was found in the Oakland-Alameda  area for the first time and over 95% of all spawning occurred in the southern part of San Francisco Bay.  During the past six seasons in San Francisco Bay, over 70% of all spawning escapement has been in the southern part of the bay. For the nine seasons prior to that, 94% of all spawning escapement was in the northern part of the bay.  (31pp. The 1989-90 spawning biomass estimate of Pacific herring,  Clupea pallasi, from spawning-ground surveys in San  Francisco Bay was 71,000 tons, a 5,000 ton increase over the 1988-89 biomass estimate of 66,000 tons. The San Francisco Bay herring biomass has been on an upward cycle since 1984, and results from spawning-ground surveys indicated that the population was at its highest level in eight years.  In Tomales Bay the 1989-90 herring spawning biomass estimate was 345 tons. This was the third consecutive poor season.  Herring have nearly abandoned Tomales Bay, and reduced freshwater in flows due to the current drought condition in California were the probable cause for the change in spawning behavior.  An additional 445 tons were found in Bodega Bay by  hydroacoustic surveys. The total herring biomass estimate  for Tomales-Bodega area was 790 tons.  January was the month of peak spawning activity in San  Francisco Bay, with 30,000 tons of herring spawning during  the month. In Tomales there was only one spawning run; it  occurred on January 31, 1990.  In San Francisco Bay, 67% of all spawning occurred along   the San Francisco waterfront, and only 6% of all spawning  activity was in the northern part of the bay. No spawning  was found near Tiburon, Belvedere, Richmond, Berkeley,  Candlestick Point, Sierra Point, Oyster Point, or Coyote  Point.  A total of 3.5 million m2 of eelgrass, Zoster marina, was  measured in Tomales Bay this season, a decline of about  10% over the past two seasons.  Eelgrass density kg/m2 did not change significantly this  season.  (34pp. Diurnal periodicity of spawning in the perch so far are rather meagre and found to be partly contrary to experiences of perch anglers. Therefore a study was made on the spawning during a 5-day period in the spring of 1971 in the Kuusamo area. Observations were made during the main spawning season, between 4- 9 June 1971. The perch were often measured, weighed and then released back into the water. The differences between spawning and non-spawning perch were studied as well as the time of roe discharge in a 24 hour period. Activity and environmental factors such as light intensity were also taken into consideration	['4630180', '5126966', '4630338', '4630259', '4632611']	[[{'name': 'Frey, Herbert W.'}, {'name': 'Knaggs, Eric H.'}], [{'name': 'Berzins, V.'}, {'name': 'Hinrichsen, Hans-Harald'}, {'name': 'Köster, Friedrich'}, {'name': 'Plikshs, M.'}, {'name': 'Tomkiewicz, Jonna'}], [{'name': 'Spratt, Jerome D.'}], [{'name': 'Spratt, Jerome D.'}], [{'name': 'Ellonen, T.'}, {'name': 'Keranen, M.'}, {'name': 'Kukko, O.'}, {'name': 'Lind, E.

c11c3625-4954-473c-96df-bb925a78411c	t1dm	OBJECTIVE: Integrity of resting-state functional brain networks (RSNs) is important for proper cognitive functioning. In type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) cognitive decrements are commonly observed, possibly due to alterations in RSNs, which may vary according to microvascular complication status. Thus, we tested the hypothesis that functional connectivity in RSNs differs according to clinical status and correlates with cognition in T1DM patients, using an unbiased approach with high spatio-temporal resolution functional network.; METHODS: Resting-state magnetoencephalographic (MEG) data for T1DM patients with (n=42) and without (n=41) microvascular complications and 33 healthy participants were recorded. MEG time-series at source level were reconstructed using a recently developed atlas-based beamformer. Functional connectivity within classical frequency bands, estimated by the phase lag index (PLI), was calculated within eight commonly found RSNs. Neuropsychological tests were used to assess cognitive performance, and the relation with RSNs was evaluated.; RESULTS: Significant differences in terms of RSN functional connectivity between the three groups were observed in the lower alpha band, in the default-mode (DMN), executive control (ECN) and sensorimotor (SMN) RSNs. T1DM patients with microvascular complications showed the weakest functional connectivity in these networks relative to the other groups. For DMN, functional connectivity was higher in patients without microangiopathy relative to controls (all p<0.05). General cognitive performance for both patient groups was worse compared with healthy controls. Lower DMN alpha band functional connectivity correlated with poorer general cognitive ability in patients with microvascular complications.; DISCUSSION: Altered RSN functional connectivity was found in T1DM patients depending on clinical status. Lower DMN functional connectivity was related to poorer cognitive functioning. These results indicate that functional connectivity may play a key role in T1DM-related cognitive dysfunction &lt;p&gt;Background: Randomized controlled trials have shown the importance of tight glucose control in type 1 diabetes (T1DM), but few recent studies have evaluated the risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD) and all-cause mortality among adults with T1DM. We evaluated these risks in adults with T1DM compared with the non-diabetic population in a nationwide study from Scotland and examined control of CVD risk factors in those with T1DM.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;Methods and Findings: The Scottish Care Information-Diabetes Collaboration database was used to identify all people registered with T1DM and aged ≥20 years in 2005–2007 and to provide risk factor data. Major CVD events and deaths were obtained from the national hospital admissions database and death register. The age-adjusted incidence rate ratio (IRR) for CVD and mortality in T1DM (n = 21,789) versus the non-diabetic population (3.96 million) was estimated using Poisson regression. The age-adjusted IRR for first CVD event associated with T1DM versus the non-diabetic population was higher in women (3.0: 95% CI 2.4–3.8, p&#60;0.001) than men (2.3: 2.0–2.7, p&#60;0.001) while the IRR for all-cause mortality associated with T1DM was comparable at 2.6 (2.2–3.0, p&#60;0.001) in men and 2.7 (2.2–3.4, p&#60;0.001) in women. Between 2005–2007, among individuals with T1DM, 34 of 123 deaths among 10,173 who were &#60;40 years and 37 of 907 deaths among 12,739 who were ≥40 years had an underlying cause of death of coma or diabetic ketoacidosis. Among individuals 60–69 years, approximately three extra deaths per 100 per year occurred among men with T1DM (28.51/1,000 person years at risk), and two per 100 per year for women (17.99/1,000 person years at risk). 28% of those with T1DM were current smokers, 13% achieved target HbA1c of &#60;7% and 37% had very poor (≥9%) glycaemic control. Among those aged ≥40, 37% had blood pressures above even conservative targets (≥140/90 mmHg) and 39% of those ≥40 years were not on a statin. Although many of these risk factors were comparable to those previously reported in other developed countries, CVD and mortality rates may not be generalizable to other countries. Limitations included lack of information on the specific insulin therapy used.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;Conclusions: Although the relative risks for CVD and total mortality associated with T1DM in this population have declined relative to earlier studies, T1DM continues to be associated with higher CVD and death rates than the non-diabetic population. Risk factor management should be improved to further reduce risk but better treatment approaches for achieving good glycaemic control are badly needed.&lt;/p&gt Aims:    Inpatient hypoglycaemia is common and associated with adverse outcomes. There is often increased vigilance of hypoglycaemia in inpatients with type 1 diabetes (T1DM) compared to type 2 diabetes (T2DM). We aimed to investigate this apparent discrepancy, utilising the time to repeat (TTR) capillary blood glucose (CBG) measurement as a surrogate for engagement with guidelines stating that CBG should be rechecked following intervention within 15 min of an initial CBG of &lt;4 mmol/L.    Methods:    This is an observational study of inpatient CBG data from 8 hospitals over a 7-year period. A national diabetes registry allowed identification of individual’s diagnosis and diabetes therapy. For each initial (index) CBG, the TTR for individuals with T2DM—on insulin or sulphonylurea—was compared with the TTR for individuals with T1DM, using a t test for significance performed on log(TTR). The median TTR was plotted for each group per index CBG.    Results:    In total, 1480,335 CBG measurements were obtained. A total of 26,664 were &lt;4 mmol/L. The TTR in T2DM individuals on sulphonylurea was significantly greater than in T1DM individuals where index CBG was ≥2.3 mmol/L (except index CBG 2.6 mmol/L). For T2DM patients receiving insulin significance exists for index CBGs of ≥3.2 mmol/L.    Conclusions:    This analysis suggests that quality of care of hypoglycaemia varies according to diagnosis and medication. The group with the highest TTR (T2DM sulphonylurea treated) are possibly the clinical group in whom hypoglycaemia is most concerning. These data therefore suggest a need for education and raising awareness within the inpatient nursing staff Type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) usually begins in childhood and adolescence and causes lifelong damage to several major organs including the brain. Despite increasing evidence of T1DM-induced structural deficits in cortical regions implicated in higher cognitive and emotional functions, little is known whether and how the structural connectivity between these regions is altered in the T1DM brain. Using inter-regional covariance of cortical thickness measurements from high-resolution T1-weighted magnetic resonance data, we examined the topological organizations of cortical structural networks in 81 T1DM patients and 38 healthy subjects. We found a relative absence of hierarchically high-level hubs in the prefrontal lobe of T1DM patients, which suggests ineffective top-down control of the prefrontal cortex in T1DM. Furthermore, inter-network connections between the strategic/executive control system and systems subserving other cortical functions including language and mnemonic/emotional processing were also less integrated in T1DM patients than in healthy individuals. The current results provide structural evidence for T1DM-related dysfunctional cortical organization, which specifically underlie the top-down cognitive control of language, memory, and emotion. © 2013 Lyoo et al Background:  The consequences of subclinical coeliac disease (CD) in Type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) remain unclear. We looked at growth, anthropometry and disease management in children with dual diagnosis (T1DM + CD) before and after CD diagnosis.&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;    Methods:  Anthropometry, glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c) and IgA tissue transglutaminase (tTg) were collected prior to, and following CD diagnosis in 23 children with T1DM + CD. This group was matched for demographics, T1DM duration, age at CD diagnosis and at T1DM onset with 23 CD and 44 T1DM controls.&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;    Results:  No differences in growth or anthropometry were found between children with T1DM + CD and controls at any time point. Children with T1DM + CD, had higher BMI z-score two years prior to, than at CD diagnosis (p &#60;0.001). BMI z-score change one year prior to CD diagnosis was lower in the T1DM + CD than the T1DM group (p = 0.009). At two years, height velocity and change in BMI z-scores were similar in all groups. No differences were observed in HbA1c between the T1DM + CD and T1DM groups before or after CD diagnosis. More children with T1DM + CD had raised tTg levels one year after CD diagnosis than CD controls (CDx to CDx + 1 yr; T1DM + CD: 100% to 71%, p = 0.180 and CD: 100% to 45%, p &#60; 0.001); by two years there was no difference.&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;    Conclusions:  No major nutrition or growth deficits were observed in children with T1DM + CD. CD diagnosis does not impact on T1DM glycaemic control. CD specific serology was comparable to children with single CD, but those with dual diagnosis may need more time to adjust to gluten free diet Aim: To investigate the count of circulating tissue factor-positive (TF +) procoagulant microparticles (MPs) in patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM).Methods: This case-control study included patients with T1DM and age and sex-matched healthy volunteers. The counts of phosphatidylserine-positive (PS +) MPs and TF +PS +MPs and the subgroups derived from different cell types were measured in the peripheral blood sample of the two groups using multicolor flow cytometric assay. We compared the counts of each MP between groups as well as the ratio of the TF +PS +MPs and PS +MPs (TF +PS +MPs/PS +MPs).Results: We recruited 36 patients with T1DM and 36 matched healthy controls. Compared with healthy volunteers, PS +MPs, TF +PS +MPs and TF +PS +MPs/PS +MPs were elevated in patients with T1DM (PS +MPs: 1078.5 ± 158.08 vs 686.84 ± 122.04/μL, P &lt;0.001; TF + PS +MPs: 202.10 ± 47.47 vs 108.33 ± 29.42/μL, P &lt;0.001; and TF +PS +MPs/PS +MPs: 0.16 ± 0.04 vs 0.19 ± 0.05, P = 0.004), mostly derived from platelet, lymphocytes and endothelial cells. In the subgroup analysis, the counts of total and platelet TF +PS +MPs were increased in patients with diabetic retinopathy (DR) and with higher HbA1c, respectively.Conclusion: Circulating TF +PS +MPs and those derived from platelet, lymphocytes and endothelial cells were elevated in patients with T1DM. </p Context:  The pathophysiological mechanism of increased fractures in young adults with Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus (T1DM) is unclear.    Objective:  Case:control study of trabecular bone microarchitecture and vertebral marrow adiposity in young women with T1DM.    Patients and Settings:  30 women with T1DM with a median (range) age of 22.0yrs (16.9, 36.1) attending one outpatient clinic with a median age at diagnosis of 9.7yrs (0.46, 14.8) were compared to 28 age-matched healthy women who acted as controls.    Methods and Main Outcome Measures:  Measurements included MRI-based assessment of proximal tibial bone volume/total volume (appBV/TV), trabecular separation (appTb.Sp), vertebral bone marrow adiposity (BMA) and abdominal adipose tissue and biochemical markers of GH/IGF-1 axis (IGF-1, IGFBP3, ALS) and bone turnover.    Results:  Median appBV/TV in cases and controls was 0.3 (0.22, 0.37) and 0.33 (0.26, 0.4), respectively (p = 0.018) and median appTb.Sp in T1DM was 2.59 (2.24, 3.38) and 2.32 (2.03, 2.97), respectively (p = 0.012). The median appBV/TV was 0.28 (0.22, 0.33) in those cases with retinopathy (n,15) compared to 0.33 (0.25, 0.37) in those without retinopathy (p = 0.02). Although median visceral adipose tissue in cases was higher than in controls at 5,733mm3 (2030, 11,144) and 3,460mm3 (1,808, 6,832), respectively (p = 0.012), there was no difference in median BMA which was 31.1% (9.9, 59.9) and 26.3% (8.5, 49.8) in cases and controls, respectively (p = 0.2). Serum IGF-1 and ALS were also lower in cases and the latter showed an inverse association to appTbSp (r = -0.30, p = 0.04).    Conclusion:  Detailed MRI studies in young women with childhood-onset T1DM have shown clear deficits in trabecular microarchitecture of the tibia.

c26da2e8-51d5-40eb-9874-2ea400591e5d	climate change	SUMMARY   This is the Climate Change Authority\u27s second review of the Renewable Energy Target (RET). The RET targets reductions in greenhouse gas emissions from the electricity sector and thereby contributes significantly to reducing Australia\u27s overall emissions.  In its 2012 review of the RET, the Authority found that the RET was stimulating considerable investment in renewable energy and argued that a stable and predictable policy was essential to sustain this investment. It concluded that no major changes were warranted to the overall RET design, but suggested some minor operational changes.  The uncertain future of the Authority until recently has limited the time available to conduct this review. Largely for that reason, the Authority has focused on what, it its view, are the most important issues. The Authority has also drawn on both its 2012 Authority review, and on the review conducted this year by a panel headed by Mr Dick Warburton AO LVO.  The RET and Australia\u27s emissions reduction goals   In 2010, when the Large-scale Renewable Energy Target (LRET) was set at 41,000 GWh, it was estimated that this contribution, with contributions from the Small-scale Renewable Energy Scheme (SRES) and other pre-existing renewables (notably hydro), would together represent at least 20 per cent of Australia’s (then) projected total electricity demand in 2020. Given that electricity accounts for approximately one-third of Australia’s emissions of greenhouse gases, renewable sources were seen as making a significant contribution to Australia’s broader emissions reduction goals.  Reducing emissions in the electricity sector plays a pivotal role in climate change policies around the world. Unchecked climate change is widely seen as posing serious risks for the Australian community and its economy. Together with the broader international community, Australia has agreed to a goal of limiting global warming to no more than 2 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels to avoid the worst impacts of climate change. This requires concerted action by all countries— including Australia—to reduce their greenhouse gas emissions. The RET, as currently legislated, is a significant part of Australia’s policy response to that challenge.  The RET arrangements were envisaged to deliver ‘at least 20 per cent’ of Australia’s electricity from renewable sources by 2020 and are projected to reduce Australia\u27s emissions by 58 million tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent (Mt CO2-e) over 2015–20, and by much larger amounts in later periods.  The RET arrangements are not perfect but, in the Authority’s view, they are effective in reducing emissions (at reasonable cost) in the centrally important electricity sector. Given the absence of effective alternative measures bearing upon this sector, the Authority does not favour any significant scaling back of the 2020 LRET target of 41,000 GWh SUMMARY  The Authority is required by legislation to review the Carbon Farming Initiative (CFI) every three years; this is its first review. The review has benefited from consultations with stakeholders from a range of sectors and the Authority thanks those who contributed.  When introduced in 2011, the CFI was designed to complement the carbon pricing mechanism. Accordingly, it focused on sectors not covered by the carbon price, namely: agriculture, waste (in part), and land use, land use change and forestry. CFI projects earned credits that could be sold to entities with liabilities under the carbon pricing mechanism.  The carbon price has since been repealed, and the CFI has been expanded to form the Emissions Reduction Fund (ERF) and now covers all sectors of the economy. The ERF is the central plank of the government’s Direct Action Plan to reduce Australia’s greenhouse gas emissions. It has been introduced through amendments to the Carbon Credits (Carbon Farming Initiative) Act 2011 (Cth), which brings it within the scope of this review. For simplicity’s sake, this report refers to the CFI as the scheme as originally configured, and the ERF as the scheme as approved by the parliament in November 2014.  Under the ERF, the government will purchase emissions reductions through auctions (and possibly other means). Fixed-price contracts, typically for seven years, will be offered to those who are successful at auction. Other changes to streamline the scheme are also being introduced, and a safeguard mechanism (that will discourage large emitters from increasing their emissions above historical levels) is to commence in July 2016.  While these changes are substantial, the ERF retains an essential characteristic of the CFI in that it credits projects for reducing emissions below a defined baseline, and the baseline reflects what would have been expected to occur in the absence of the scheme.  The changes to the CFI are important for this review in two ways. First, as the scheme is being expanded to become the central element of Australia’s policy to reduce emissions and meet its targets, the lessons to be gleaned from its operation to date will be of interest in assessing the likely performance of the ERF. Second, as this review follows closely on the policy development process for the ERF, care has been taken not to duplicate that process, but to focus instead on the extent to which the design of the ERF addresses problems identified with the CFI, as well as other challenges that may arise The 2019 organizational chart for the University of Maine Climate Change Institute submitted with the institute\u27s annual report. The chart reveals names of research staff and research themes I am requesting funding for Dr. Vaughn Bryant\u27s recent visit (March 19-21) to UMaine where he met with a diversity of researchers across campus and presented two lectures on his areas of expertise. Vaughn is Professor of Anthropology and Director of the Palynology Laboratory at Texas A&M University. He is internationally known for his research in forensic pollen analysis, prehistoric diet reconstruction, honey research, and in the reconstruction of paleoenvironments. Dr. Bryant conducts extensive forensic palynological investigations for the CIA, DOE, and Customs and Border Protection (CBP). He pioneered efforts in three new and emerging areas of pollen research including: 1 ) the floral sources used by honeybees to produce honey, the use of pollen coefficient data to identify and verify premium grades of honey, and techniques used to identify the geographical origin of commercially-imported and exported honey; 2) the use of pollen data to track and help eradicate agricultural insect pests such as the boll weevil, corn earworm, root worm, and celery looper; and 3) the use of pollen as an important forensic tool used to track and convict criminals. Dr. Bryant has published numerous books, over 150 scholarly publications, and hundreds of presentations around the globe, and he was honored with the prestigious Fryxell Award for Interdisciplinary Research by the Society for American Archaeology, the premiere archaeology society. He has appeared on the Today Show, CNN, Fox Network News, the BBC, CBS News, 3-2- 1 Contact, and the Discovery Channel. His c.v. is attached Climate change impacts bring great uncertainty, raising the need to plan for the future. As the impacts of climate change are complex and far-reaching, it can be extremely difficult to foresee exactly what the consequences will be, and how they will affect different regions and sectors. However, by bringing together relevant stakeholders and brainstorming "what if" ideas of possible future scenarios, policy makers can prepare themselves for a variety of potential challenges. Including stakeholders from diverse backgrounds can avoid blindspots focused on a single vision of the future This report presents results from a national study of what Americans understand about how the climate system works, and the causes, impacts, and potential solutions to global warming. Among other findings, the study identifies a number of important gaps in public knowledge and common misconceptions about climate change. Educational levels: Graduate or professional, Undergraduate upper division, Undergraduate lower division, General public Knowledge of factors that trigger human response to climate change is crucial for effective climate change policy communication. Climate change has been claimed to have low salience as a risk issue because it cannot be directly experienced. Still, personal factors such as strength of belief in local effects of climate change have been shown to correlate strongly with responses to climate change and there is a growing literature on the hypothesis that personal experience of climate change (and/or its effects) explains responses to climate change. Here we provide, using survey data from 845 private forest owners operating in a wide range of bio-climatic as well as economic-social-political structures in a latitudinal gradient across Europe, the first evidence that the personal strength of belief and perception of local effects of climate change, highly significantly explain human responses to climate change. A logistic regression model was fitted to the two variables, estimating expected probabilities ranging from 0.07 (SD +/-0.01) to 0.81 (SD +/-0.03) for self-reported adaptive measures taken. Adding socio-demographic variables improved the fit, estimating expected probabilities ranging from 0.022 (SD +/-0.008) to 0.91 (SD +/-0.02). We conclude that to explain and predict adaptation to climate change, the combination of personal experience and belief must be considered This IPCC Special Report provides the latest comprehensive assessment of the ocean and cryosphere in a changing climate. It serves policymakers, decision makers, stakeholders, and all interested parties with unbiased, up-to-date, policy-relevant information. This title is also available as Open Access on Cambridge Core The paper consists of a summary of the main sources of uncertainty about climate change, and a discussion of the major implications for economic analysis and the formulation of climate policy. Uncertainty typically implies that the optimal policy is more risk-averse than otherwise, and therefore enhances the case for action to mitigate climate change Presents the Climate Change Authority\u27s recommendations on Australia\u27s future emissions reduction targets, and constitutes the first part of the Authority\u27s response to the Special Review requested by the Minister for the Environment in December 2014.  Background  This report builds on the work in the Authority\u27s recent report, Reducing Australia’s Greenhouse Gas Emissions—Targets and Progress Review , which was provided to the Minister (and released publicly) on 27 February 2014. That report, which reflected extensive public consultation, presented the Authority’s comprehensive assessment of the evidence coming from climate scientists, the efforts being made by other countries to reduce their emissions, and the targets judged to be in Australia’s best interests. The Authority recommended a target for&nbsp; 2020 and a trajectory range for emissions out to 2030. It also recommended a long-term emissions budget to guide Australia’s planning over the period to 2050.  &nbsp;   Weighing up all the relevant factors, the Authority recommended a 2020 target for Australia of 19 per cent below 2000 levels. By way of guidance for the period beyond 2020, the Authority recommended a trajectory range to 2030 of emissions reductions of between 40 and 60 per cent below 2000 levels. Under the Clean Energy Act 2011 (Cth) the Government was obliged to respond to these recommendations by the end of August 2014 but, with the repeal of that Act, this obligation lapsed.  &nbsp;  In preparing this current report, the Authority has revisited the material underpinning its February 2014 report and updated its analysis in the light of new information that has emerged since that time, particularly in regard to the science of climate change and the recent efforts of many countries to reduce their greenhouse gas emissions.  &nbsp;   The Authority believes this new information supports its previous assessment that Australia\u27s conditions for moving some way beyond its unconditional target have been met. These conditions included increased clarity around the level and credibility of international action and agreement on emissions accounting and reporting. Australia\u27s commitment under the UNFCCC includes an unconditional emissions reduction target of 5 per cent below 2000 levels by 2020, and conditional targets of up to 15 or 25 per cent.  &nbsp;   The present Government has shown no inclination to move beyond the unconditional 2020 target. The consequences of limiting Australia\u27s emissions reductions to this minimum 5 per cent target have been factored into the Authority’s consideration of appropriate post-2020 targets.  &nbsp We are pleased to share with you our SmartAg Partner bi-annual newsletter, highlighting policy engagement, ongoing research, field updates and activities with partners from the second half of 2019	['19213433', '19213188', '8055739', '120094697', '63104824', '45802467', '2380924', '4978687', '128015418', '6301630', '85974482', '19209984', '81792601']	[[{'name': 'Climate Change Authority'}], [{'name': 'Climate Change Authority'}], [{'name': 'Framework Convention on Climate Change,'}, {'name': 'Peake, Stephen'}], [{'name': 'Climate Change Institute'}], [{'name': 'Climate Change Institute'}], [{'name': 'CGIAR Research Program on Climate Change, Agriculture and Food Security'}], [{'name': 'Anthony Leiserowitz'}, {'name': 'Connie Roser - Renouf'}, {'name': 'Edward Maibach'}, {'name': 'Geoff Feinberg'}, {'name': 'Peter Howe'}], [{'name': 'Blennow, Kristina'}, {'name': 'Hanewinkel, Marc'}, {'name': 'Persson, Johannes'}, {'name': 'Tomé, Margarida'}], [{'name': 'Panel on Climate Change, Intergovernmental'}], [{'name': 'Adamson'}, {'name': 'Annan'}, {'name': 'Arrow'}, {'name': 'Burkeman'}, {'name': 'Hamilton'}, {'name': 'Harvey'}, {'name': 'Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change'}, {'name': 'Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change'}, {'name': 'Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change'}, {'name': 'Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change'}, {'name': 'Oreskes'}, {'name': 'Pearse'}, {'name': 'Pratt'}, {'name': 'Quiggin'}, {'name': 'Quiggin'}, {'name': 'Society'}, {'name': 'Stainforth'}, {'name': 'Stern'}, {'name': 'Thorpe'}, {'name': 'Trigeorgis'}, {'name': 'Weitzman'}], [{'name': 'Climate Change Center of China Meteorological Administration'}, {'name': 'Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change'}, {'name': 'Kendall M.

A multilayered Monte Carlo Radiation Transfer model is presented where both daylight activated PDT and conventional PDT are compared. It was found that light penetrates deeper through older skin with a lighter complexion, which translates into a deeper effective treatment depth. The effect of ageing was found to be larger for darker skin types. The investigation further strengthens the usage of daylight as a potential light source for PDT where effective treatment depths of about 2 mm can be achieved.Publisher PD Human skin ageing is a complex and heterogeneous process, which is influenced by genetically determined intrinsic factors and accelerated by cumulative exposure to extrinsic stressors. In the current world ageing demographic, there is a requirement for a bioengineered ageing skin model, to further the understanding of the intricate molecular mechanisms of skin ageing, and provide a distinct and biologically relevant platform for testing actives and formulations. There have been many recent advances in the development of skin models that recapitulate aspects of the ageing phenotype in vitro. This review encompasses the features of skin ageing, the molecular mechanisms that drive the ageing phenotype, and tissue engineering strategies that have been utilised to bioengineer ageing skin in vitro The authors thank Dr Almudena Fuster-Manzano and Dr Blanca Piedrafita for providing scientific support.To characterize the exposome of the Spanish population and its association with skin ageing a cross-sectional epidemiological study was conducted in men and women (18–60 years old). A total of 1,474 participants were included. Mean age (± standard deviation) was 40.84 ± 10.26 years. Most participants had Fitzpatrick skin phototype II (44.1%) and skin ageing in accordance with their current age (69.0%). In the logistic model, age, smoking habit, use of sunscreen and use of cosmetics were all significant independent predictors of skin ageing. Thus, tobacco consumption increased the score of the model towards presenting skin ageing above that expected for age, while the opposite occurred with the use of sunscreen and a complete skin care routine. The exposome therefore has an impact on skin ageing, with age, smoking habit, use of sunscreen and the use of cosmetics identified as predictors of skin ageing. Skin care routines and sunscreen use may help to prevent this process.Vich Understanding people’s experience of skin ageing as it is lived can enable sensitive approaches to promoting healthy skin and to care in general. By understanding the insider perspective, what it is like for individuals, a way to sensitise practice for more humanly sensitive care is offered. Through interviews with seventeen, community-dwelling older people the essential meaning of living within ageing skin was illuminated as a state of managed inevitability. The skin is inevitably changing,  ageing skin is a marker of change over time but the person within remains. Constituents of the phenomenon comprise:  the experience of unfamiliar sights and sensations given by ageing skin; facing and accepting bodily changes and seeing this back and forth in family connections; taking care of the skin ‘to face’ the world and to present oneself to others and a different place in the world, same person, changed body. Findings point to why and how nurses can treat older people as persons by not over emphasising a view on ageing bodies or bodies with aged skin alone, but in tempering this view with deeper existential insights, meeting the older person with a skin care need as a person and not just as a physical entity Ageing describes the decreased functionality and inability to resist physiological stress exhibited by all tissues as they get older. The skin is no exception to this rule; experiencing both intrinsic and extrinsic ageing which results in the remodelling of the entire tissue through degradation of extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins. In recent years, advancements in 2D cell culture and 3D bioengineered skin models have begun to help us better understand the workings of human skin. However, there is a need for the development of an ‘aged’ skin model, which would offer an innovative opportunity to further explore the ageing process, in a realistic, reproducible and readily available format. A key aspect of any ageing model, is that it must exhibit changes in biomarkers that have been linked to in vivo skin ageing. With this in mind, this project aims to identify key biomarkers of ageing through analysis of both mRNA and protein levels; specifically focusing on the dermal compartment As the limits of human lifespan continue to expand, ageing biologists must address the decline in the integrity of bodily tissues with time. Our skin is drastically impacted by both intrinsic and extrinsic ageing processes, driven by gradual accumulation of cellular damage and environmental insults like ultra-violet irradiation.  Together intrinsic and extrinsic skin ageing give rise to clinical issues such as xerosis, pruritus and neoplasms. Cosmetic issues, such as unsightly wrinkling, thinning and sagging of the skin also impact human psychological and social wellbeing. Given these issues, studying the molecular mechanisms of intrinsic and extrinsic skin ageing processes is an important element of biological research, as a better understanding of how these processes contribute to reduced tissue integrity will allow us to develop therapies to attenuate the ageing process.   Using tissues taken from C57BL/6 male mice and female humans as our models, we analysed skin at early, middle and late stages within both the murine and human lifespans to assess the impact of ageing on changes in the epidermis, dermis and at the basement membrane. By considering tissue taken from photo-protected and photo-exposed sites of humans, we additionally studied the differential changes occurring during intrinsic and extrinsic skin ageing (photo-ageing).  Our studies showed that several morphometric changes occur to the epidermis with age in mouse skin, where we observed thinning and cellular loss. Cell proliferation and lamin B1 levels declined, which was coupled with decreased expression of dermal and basement membrane collagens. Many of these observations were ubiquitous in intrinsically aged human skin, where we additionally show unique transcriptional changes at the basement membrane. One little studied pathway in skin ageing is the Hippo pathway, which has crucial roles in epidermal development through its control of epidermal cell proliferation. We identify a novel modulation of the Hippo pathway effector YAP1 in aged mouse and human skin, where we show that nuclear localisation of YAP1 increases during epidermal ageing.  Together this body of work demonstrates that C57BL/6 mouse skin ageing shares common mechanisms of intrinsic human skin ageing. Additionally, we show that YAP1 localisation is altered during epidermal ageing, which suggests that the Hippo pathway is sensitive to both changes in the extra-cellular matrix content, and cell-proliferation properties of skin over time Solar radiation causes a variety of biologic effects in the skin which are predominantly harmful. The only recognised beneficial effect is that of endogenous photosynthesis of vitamin D from its precursors in the skin, the importance of which is greatly diminished by a well balanced diet. Acute excessive exposure to ultraviolet radiation (UVR) causes sunburn, whereas chronic overexposure is responsible for the process of photo ageing and skin cancer. This sun related degenerative process and neoplastic transformation may be effectively minimised by an increased public awareness of the harmful effect of the sun.peer-reviewe	['18671561', '18541283', '89339259', '8968283', '8548621', '8548082', '26559107']	[[{'name': 'Brown, C Tom A'}, {'name': 'Campbell, Catherine Louise'}, {'name': 'Christison, C.'}, {'name': 'Moseley, H.'}, {'name': 'Valentine, Ronan Martin'}, {'name': 'Wood, Kenny'}], [{'name': 'Bascom, Charlie'}, {'name': 'Costello, Lydia'}, {'name': 'Dicolandrea, Teresa'}, {'name': 'Isfort, Robert'}, {'name': 'Przyborski, Stefan'}, {'name': 'Tasseff, Ryan'}, {'name': 'von Zglinicki, Thomas'}], [{'name': 'Abarquero, Mercedes'}, {'name': 'Arias Santiago, Salvador Antonio'}, {'name': 'Buendía Eisman, Agustín'}, {'name': 'Prieto, Leonor'}], [{'name': 'Adam'}, {'name': 'Baker'}, {'name': 'Beeckman'}, {'name': 'Blume-Peytavi'}, {'name': 'Bullington'}, {'name': 'Bullington'}, {'name': 'Carville'}, {'name': 'Cowdell'}, {'name': 'Cowdell'}, {'name': 'Dahlberg'}, {'name': 'Dahlberg'}, {'name': 'Dahlberg'}, {'name': 'Drummond'}, {'name': 'Dumas'}, {'name': 'Fleischer'}, {'name': 'Galvin'}, {'name': 'Goldberg'}, {'name': 'Hamill'}, {'name': 'Hamilton'}, {'name': 'Healy'}, {'name': 'Heidegger'}, {'name': 'Heidegger'}, {'name': 'Hofmeier'}, {'name': 'Hogan'}, {'name': 'Hopkins'}, {'name': 'Hurd Clarke'}, {'name': 'Hurd Clarke'}, {'name': 'Hurd Clarke'}, {'name': 'Hurd Clarke'}, {'name': 'Hurd Clarke'}, {'name': 'Hurd Clarke'}, {'name': 'Hurd Clarke'}, {'name': 'Husserl'}, {'name': 'Hyde'}, {'name': 'Jankowski'}, {'name': 'Johansson'}, {'name': 'Kirkup'}, {'name': 'Kottner'}, {'name': 'Krekula'}, {'name': 'Leder'}, {'name': 'Leder'}, {'name': 'Liechty'}, {'name': 'Liechty'}, {'name': 'Lindberg'}, {'name': 'Macia'}, {'name': 'Marinova'}, {'name': 'Martin'}, {'name': 'McKinley'}, {'name': 'Merleau-Ponty'}, {'name': 'Moore'}, {'name': 'Muise'}, {'name': 'Paul'}, {'name': 'Paulson'}, {'name': 'Slevin'}, {'name': 'Svenaeus'}, {'name': 'Todres'}, {'name': 'Todres'}, {'name': 'Todres'}, {'name': 'Toombs'}, {'name': 'Twigg'}, {'name': 'Voegeli'}, {'name': 'Winterich'}, {'name': 'Yeslev'}, {'name': 'Öberg'}], [{'name': 'HUNTER-FEATHERSTONE, EVE,FLOYD'}], [{'name': "O'MAHONY, KATHERINE,MARGARET"}], [{'name': 'Keefe, M.'}, {'name': 'Scerri, Lawrence'}]]	['3D Monte Carlo radiation transfer modelling of photodynamic therapy', 'Tissue engineering strategies to bioengineer the ageing skin phenotype in vitro', 'Study of the Exposome Ageing-related Factors in the Spanish Population', 'A lifeworld phenomenological study of the experience of living within ageing skin', 'Ageing Biomarkers and their role in the development of an aged skin model in vitro', 'Unveiling the molecular determinants of mammalian skin ageing: A proteomic and transcriptomic approach', 'The adverse effects of the sun on the skin : a review']	exploratory	7
c9d2a362-56c5-4d8c-b286-e1da6916513e	armadillo	AbstractActivation of the Wnt signaling cascade provides key signals during development and in disease. Here we provide evidence, by designing a Wnt receptor with ligand-independent signaling activity, that physical proximity of Arrow (LRP) to the Wnt receptor Frizzled-2 triggers the intracellular signaling cascade. We have uncovered a branch of the Wnt pathway in which Armadillo activity is regulated concomitantly with the levels of Axin protein. The intracellular pathway bypasses Gsk3β/Zw3, the kinase normally required for controlling β-catenin/Armadillo levels, suggesting that modulated degradation of Armadillo is not required for Wnt signaling. We propose that Arrow (LRP) recruits Axin to the membrane, and that this interaction leads to Axin degradation. As a consequence, Armadillo is no longer bound by Axin, resulting in nuclear signaling by Armadillo p120 catenin (p120ctn), a component of the cadherin-catenin complex, was the first member to be identified in a most interesting subfamily of the Armadillo family. Several p120ctn isoforms are generated by alternative splicing. These isoforms fulfill pleiotropic functions according to their subcellular localization: modulating the turnover rate of membrane-bound cadherins, regulating the activation of small Rho GTPases in the cytoplasm, and modulating nuclear transcription. Over the last two decades, knowledge of p120ctn has grown remarkably, and this has been achieved in part by using different animal models. At least in frog and mammals, p120ctn is essential for normal development and homeostasis. Here we will discuss the effects of different p120ctn isoforms on cadherin turnover and on signaling in the cytoplasm and the nucleus. We will also elaborate on the structure and function of other members of the p120ctn subfamily: ARVCF, p0071 and delta-catenin. Finally, we will overview the respective roles of p120ctn family members in pathological processes, and particularly in cancer as p120ctn is frequently downregulated or mislocalized in various human tumors Background: Armadillo, the Drosophila orthologue of vertebrate beta-catenin, plays a dual role as the key effector of Wingless/Wnt1 signalling, and as a bridge between E-Cadherin and the actin cytoskeleton. In the absence of ligand, Armadillo is phosphorylated and targeted to the proteasome. Upon binding of Wg to its receptors, the "degradation complex'' is inhibited; Armadillo is stabilised and enters the nucleus to transcribe targets. Methodology/Principal Findings: Although the relationship between signalling and adhesion has been extensively studied, few in vivo data exist concerning how the "transcriptional'' and "adhesive'' pools of Armadillo are regulated to orchestrate development. We have therefore addressed how the subcellular distribution of Armadillo and its association with E-Cadherin change in larval wing imaginal discs, under wild type conditions and upon signalling. Using confocal microscopy, we show that Armadillo and E-Cadherin are spatio-temporally regulated during development, and that a punctate species becomes concentrated in a subapical compartment in response to Wingless. In order to further dissect this phenomenon, we overexpressed Armadillo mutants exhibiting different levels of activity and stability, but retaining E-Cadherin binding. Arm(S10) displaces endogenous Armadillo from the AJ and the basolateral membrane, while leaving E-Cadherin relatively undisturbed. Surprisingly, Delta NArm(1-155) caused displacement of both Armadillo and E-Cadherin, results supported by our novel method of quantification. However, only membrane-targeted Myr-Delta NArm(1-155) produced comparable nuclear accumulation of Armadillo and signalling to Arm(S10). These experiments also highlighted a row of cells at the A/P boundary depleted of E-Cadherin at the AJ, but containing actin. Conclusions/Significance: Taken together, our results provide in vivo evidence for a complex non-linear relationship between Armadillo levels, subcellular distribution and Wingless signalling. Moreover, this study highlights the importance of Armadillo in regulating the subcellular distribution of E-CadherinPublisher PDFPeer reviewe https://scholarworks.utrgv.edu/renetorrespub/1016/thumbnail.jp A subset of signaling pathways play exceptionally important roles in embryonic and post-embryonic development, and mis-regulation of these pathways occurs in most human cancers. One such pathway is the Wnt pathway. The primary mechanism keeping Wnt signaling off in the absence of ligand is regulated proteasomal destruction of the canonical Wnt effector ßcatenin (or its fly homolog Armadillo). A substantial body of evidence indicates that SCF(βTrCP) mediates βcat destruction, however, an essential role for Roc1 has not been demonstrated in this process, as would be predicted. In addition, other E3 ligases have also been proposed to destroy βcat, suggesting that βcat destruction may be regulated differently in different tissues.Here we used cultured Drosophila cells, human colon cancer cells, and Drosophila embryos and larvae to explore the machinery that targets Armadillo for destruction. Using RNAi in Drosophila S2 cells to examine which SCF components are essential for Armadillo destruction, we find that Roc1/Roc1a is essential for regulating Armadillo stability, and that in these cells the only F-box protein playing a detectable role is Slimb. Second, we find that while embryonic and larval Drosophila tissues use the same destruction complex proteins, the response of these tissues to destruction complex inactivation differs, with Armadillo levels more elevated in embryos. We provide evidence consistent with the possibility that this is due to differences in armadillo mRNA levels. Third, we find that there is no correlation between the ability of different APC2 mutant proteins to negatively regulate Armadillo levels, and their recently described function in positively-regulating Wnt signaling. Finally, we demonstrate that APC proteins lacking the N-terminal Armadillo-repeat domain cannot restore Armadillo destruction but retain residual function in negatively-regulating Wnt signaling.We use these data to refine our model for how Wnt signaling is regulated during normal development Armadillos represent the most diverse family of xenarthrans. Although many studies have been done on these mammals, several topics, such as their local distribution, natural history, behavioral ecology and conservation, remain poorly known. Chaetophractus villosus and Zaedyus pichiy are the most common armadillos in extra-Andean Patagonia, a vast area in southern Argentina and Chile that encompasses different ecosystems and has been modified by human activities, mainly by sheep grazing. In this work we present new data on the distribution, natural history, conservation, and ecology of C. villosus and Z. pichiy from central Patagonia (Chubut and Río Negro provinces, Argentina). We registered 60 localities for C. villosus and 35 for Z. pichiy that confirm their presence in wide sectors of central Patagonia. Furthermore, we confirmed that these two armadillo species suffer high rates of mortality due to their use as a protein source, hunting by dogs, road traffic, and poisoning, among others. We conclude that their populations are at risk of overexploitation and local extinction. The basic knowledge provided here will be a first step towards the conservation of these characteristic Patagonian mammals.Fil: Abba, Agustin Manuel.

ce5bfacf-8652-4bc1-a5b0-6144a917fb1c	streptomyces	A total of 118 actinobacterial isolates were collected from the three types of termite nests (mound, carton, and subterranean nests) to evaluate their potential as a source of bioactive actinobacteria with antimicrobial activity. The highest number (67 isolates) and generic abundance (7 known genera) of actinobacterial isolates were obtained from carton nests. Streptomyces was the dominant genus in each type of termite nest. In the non-Streptomyces group, Nocardia was the dominant genus detected in mound and carton nests, while Pseudonocardia was the dominant genus in subterranean nests. A discovery trend of novel species (&#60;99% similarity in the 16S rRNA gene sequence) was also observed in the termite nests examined. Each type of termite nest housed >20% of bioactive actinobacteria that could inhibit the growth of at least one test organism, while 12 isolates, belonging to the genera Streptomyces, Amycolatopsis, Pseudonocardia, Micromonospora and Nocardia, exhibited distinct antimicrobial activities. Streptomyces sp. CMU-NKS-3 was the most distinct bioactive isolate. It was closely related to S. padanus MITKK-103T, which was confirmed by 99% similarities in their 16S rRNA gene sequences. The highest level of extracellular antimicrobial substances was produced by the isolate CMU-NKS-3, which was grown in potato dextrose broth and exhibited a wide range (6.10×10−4–1.25 mg mL−1) of minimum inhibitory concentrations against diverse pathogens. We concluded that termite nests are an abundant source of bioactive strains of cultivable actinobacteria for future biotechnological needs Streptomyces coelicolor produces spore-forming aerial hyphae after a period of vegetative growth. These aerial structures are decorated with a hydrophobic coating of rodlets consisting of chaplins and rodlins. Here, we show that rodlins and the surface-active peptide SapB are essential for development during growth in a medium with high osmolarity. To this end, both vegetative and aerial hyphae secrete SapB, whereas rodlins are only secreted by the spore-forming aerial hyphae. An actinomycete strain referred to as TN17 was screened for its antimicrobial activities. The taxonomic status of this strain was established. The organism was found to have morphological and chemotaxonomic characteristics typical of Streptomycetes. Based on the 16S rRNA nucleotide sequences, Streptomyces sp. TN17 was found to have a relationship with Streptomyces lilaceus, Streptomyces gobitricini and Streptomyces lavendofoliae. Combined analysis of the 16 S rRNA gene sequence (FN687757), phylogenetic analysis, fatty acids profile and physiological tests indicated that there are genotypic and phenotypic differences between TN17 and neighboring Streptomyces species’ neighbors. Therefore, TN17 is a novel species: Streptomyces sp. TN17 (=DSM 42020T=CTM50229T). A cultured extract of this strain inhibits the growth of several Gram positive and Gram negative bacteria and fungi A new actinomycete strain designated TN256, producing antimicrobial activity against pathogenic bacteria and fungi, was isolated from a Tunisian Saharan soil. Morphological and chemical studies indicated that strain TN256 belonged to the genus Streptomyces. Analysis of the 16S rDNA sequence of strain TN256 showed a similarity level ranging between 99.79 and 97.8% within Streptomyces microflavus DSM 40331T and Streptomyces griseorubiginosus DSM 40469T respectively. The comparison of its physiological characteristics showed significant differences with the nearest species. Combined analysis of the 16 S rRNA gene sequences (FN687758), fatty acids profile, and results of physiological and biochemical tests indicated that there were genotypic and phenotypic differentiations of that isolate from other Streptomyces species neighbours. These date strongly suggest that strain TN256 represents a novel species with the type strain Streptomyces TN256 (=CTM50228T). Experimental validation by DNA–DNA hybridization would be required for conclusive confirmation. Four active products (1–4) were isolated from the culture broth of Streptomyces TN256 using various separation and purification steps and procedures. 1: N-[2-(1H-indol-3-yl)-2 oxo-ethyl] acetamide ‘alkaloid’ derivative; 2: di-(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate, a phthalate derivative; 3: 1-Nonadecene and 4: Cyclo (l-Pro-l-Tyr) a diketopiperazine ‘DKP’ derivative. The chemical structure of these four active compounds was established on the basis of spectroscopic studies NMR and by comparing with data from the literature. According to our biological studies, we showed in this work that the pure compounds (1–4) possess antibacterial and antifungal activities Attine ants are dependent on a cultivated fungus for food and use antibiotics produced by symbiotic Actinobacteria as weedkillers in their fungus gardens. Actinobacterial species belonging to the genera Pseudonocardia, Streptomyces and Amycolatopsis have been isolated from attine ant nests and shown to confer protection against a range of microfungal weeds. In previous work on the higher attine Acromyrmex octospinosus we isolated a Streptomyces strain that produces candicidin, consistent with another report that attine ants use Streptomyces-produced candicidin in their fungiculture. Here we report the genome analysis of this Streptomyces strain and identify multiple antibiotic biosynthetic pathways. We demonstrate, using gene disruptions and mass spectrometry, that this single strain has the capacity to make candicidin and multiple antimycin compounds. Although antimycins have been known for > 60 years we report the sequence of the biosynthetic gene cluster for the first time. Crucially, disrupting the candicidin and antimycin gene clusters in the same strain had no effect on bioactivity against a co-evolved nest pathogen called Escovopsis that has been identified in similar to 30% of attine ant nests. Since the Streptomyces strain has strong bioactivity against Escovopsis we conclude that it must make additional antifungal(s) to inhibit Escovopsis. However, candicidin and antimycins likely offer protection against other microfungal weeds that infect the attine fungal gardens. Thus, we propose that the selection of this biosynthetically prolific strain from the natural environment provides A. octospinosus with broad spectrum activity against Escovopsis and other microfungal weeds.Publisher PDFPeer reviewe The draft genome for the type strain Streptomyces phaeoluteigriseus DSM41896 (ISP 5182) is reported. It was classified as a member of the Streptomyces violaceusniger clade; however, a polyphasic study showed it was a separate species based on its distinct spore morphology and 16S rRNA sequence. The genome sequence confirms it as a separate species Streptomyces are efficient producers of various bioactive compounds, which are mostly synthesized by their secondary metabolite biosynthetic gene clusters (smBGCs). The smBGCs are tightly controlled by complex regulatory systems at transcriptional and translational levels to effectively utilize precursors that are supplied by primary metabolism. Thus, dynamic changes in gene expression in response to cellular status at both the transcriptional and translational levels should be elucidated to directly reflect protein levels, rapid downstream responses, and cellular energy costs. In this study, RNA-Seq and ribosome profiling were performed for five industrially important Streptomyces species at different growth phases, for the deep sequencing of total mRNA, and only those mRNA fragments that are protected by translating ribosomes, respectively. Herein, 12.0 to 763.8 million raw reads were sufficiently obtained with high quality of more than 80% for the Phred score Q30 and high reproducibility. These data provide a comprehensive understanding of the transcriptional and translational landscape across the Streptomyces species and contribute to facilitating the rational engineering of secondary metabolite production	['24705963', '5496209', '5188363', '5187582', '18669748', '8620173', '85972941']	[[{'name': 'Lumyong, Saisamorn'}, {'name': 'Sujada, Nikhom'}, {'name': 'Sungthong, Rungroch'}], [{'name': 'Capstick'}, {'name': 'Capstick'}, {'name': 'Chater'}, {'name': 'Chater'}, {'name': 'Claessen'}, {'name': 'Claessen'}, {'name': 'Claessen'}, {'name': 'Claessen'}, {'name': 'Dennis Claessen'}, {'name': 'Elliot'}, {'name': 'Erik Vijgenboom'}, {'name': 'Han A.B.

Moreover, any text aiming at explaining the Digital Transformation by presenting a snapshot is going to become obsolete in a blink of an eye, most likely to be already obsolete at the time it is first published. The FDC Initiative on Digital Reality felt there is a need to look at the Digital Transformation from the point of view of a profound change that is pervading the entire society—a change made possible by technology and that keeps changing due to technology evolution opening new possibilities but is also a change happening because it has strong economic reasons. The direction of this change is not easy to predict because it is steered by a cultural evolution of society, an evolution that is happening in niches and that may expand rapidly to larger constituencies and as rapidly may fade away. This creation, selection by experimentation, adoption, and sudden disappearance, is what makes the whole scenario so unpredictable and continuously changing.The amount of literature on Digital Transformation is staggering—and it keeps growing.

This creation, selection by experimentation, adoption, and sudden disappearance, is what makes the whole scenario so unpredictable and continuously changing This paper considers the interaction between digital technology and cultural organisations and the  challenges and opportunities this presents for practice and for policy. The paper is based on one of  eight 'digital R&D' projects supported by NESTA, Arts Council England and the AHRC, designed to  analyse the effects of digital innovation in UK arts organisations.    The paper focuses on a series of residencies in three UK arts organisations. The research aims to  identify the cultural conditions which support or prevent short-term digital innovation becoming  'embedded' in the ongoing practice of a cultural organisation. The paper considers differing practices,  attitudes and expectations between creative technologists and arts organisations. These differing  'cultures of innovation' may help us to understand why digital innovations often fail to move beyond  temporary and pragmatic problem-solving towards more challenging, transformational effects on  organisational strategy and culture Digital transformation is a relatively new concept in the university library environment and has become one of the key concepts of success and sustainability for university libraries in the competitive information environment. Based on the reviews conducted on the subject literature, no research was found that could present the construction requirements and the factors affecting the digital transformation of university libraries. Therefore, the purpose of the current research was to identify the components of the digital transformation of university libraries.  The approach of this research was qualitative and the Sandelowski and Barroso's seven-step meta-synthesis method (2007) has been used. The statistical population of the research includes all the scientific publications related to the foundations and dimensions of the digital transformation of university libraries, counting the scientific publications retrieved from 12 scientific databases in the period from 2004 to 2022 (corresponding to the solar Hijri years of 1383 to 1401), which is based on the Critical Appraisals Skills Programme (CASP) and screening process.  Therefore, 32 works were selected for further review and analysis. In this research, first, a separate code was considered for all the factors extracted from the selected publications, and then considering the concept of each of the codes, they were categorized in a similar concept. In this way, the concepts of the research were determined. Based on the analysis done with the help of content analysis method, there are a total of 7 main categories and 24 concepts, including digital culture (digital attitude, user-oriented, agility, participation and cooperation, creativity and innovation, learning digital skills of employees), digital librarian (individual competence, knowledge competence, communication competence, skill competence), digital manager (individual competence, knowledge competence, skill competence), digital services and resources (optimally reorganizing library resources, providing digital services to users, providing digital services to the organization mother), digital technologies (digital infrastructure, technological readiness, use digital technologies), support and cooperation of upstream institutions and the mother organization (to provide human resources, to provide technological resources and equipment, to make macro policies), and Work process and development of digital strategy (digitalization of processes and development of library digital strategy).   The discussion of the digital transformation of organizations, including the digital transformation of university libraries, is complex, and managers and librarians cannot be expected to be familiar with these concepts without training or study and be able to move in the right direction toward the digital transformation of libraries. This research is the first research inside and outside of Iran that identified the components of the digital transformation of university libraries. The results of this research can be a good guide for an easy understanding of the effective factors and requirements of digital transformation of libraries and the importance of understanding it for managers and librarians Managerial and academic literature provide only limited guidance on how to drive the digital transformation of sales. This article presents a model for in-depth analysis of sales processes, goals for each process in terms of effectiveness and efficiency, and a structured set of digital responses. For managers, it provides actionable guidelines on how to drive the digital transformation of sales, a large set of inspiring examples, and an international benchmarking opportunity The aspirations to reduce environmental impact, the ongoing labor shortages, and the expanding possibilities of digital technologies urge logistics companies to reinvent their network designs, their methods of operating, and even their business models. For the logistics sector, we provide an overview of contextual perspectives, mechanisms of change, and outcomes in digitization, digitalization, and digital transformation. Specifically, we evaluate developments and opportunities in the logistics sector from the viewpoint of food distribution in cities. We find that both customers and suppliers in the food supply chain are willing to initiate or join novel logistics concepts that require collaboration with other stakeholders in the supply chain. Notably, we investigate attitudes towards the concept of bundling, where goods of different suppliers are jointly delivered to customers by the same vehicle. Furthermore, we quantitatively demonstrate the added value of such collaborative efforts. Collaborations between companies require an increased effort in digital exchange of data and other digital technologies to reap the potential benefits we determined. We identify an impending transformation in the business model of innovative food distributors that may change the landscape of food distribution in cities Purpose- The purpose of this study is to serve as an extensive outlook about digital transformation. Its content comprises the elements of digital transformation, the ways of adapting to digital transformation, reasons for failure, means of digital transformation, and insights and discussions on new business environment. Methodology- In this study, a comprehensive literature review is followed to learn about the current business circumstances regarding digital transformation and have a deep understanding on the previous studies conducted about digital transformation. Findings- The literature review reveals that digital transformation has provided positive impract on businesses at different levels. Although challenges against digital transformation may arise, they can be tackled if the nature of digital transformation is understood well. The success of digital transformation is dependent on numerous factors from different aspect which should be studied carefully before and during the adoption of digital transformation. Conclusion- It may be concluded that the COVID-19 pandemic has accelerated the digital agenda of businesses. At first, it should be understood that digital transformation is not a mere upgrade of technology or technical equipment within an organization but requires time, curiosity, creativity, recognition of opportunities, and cultural transformation. A successful adoption of digital transformation requires the recognition of means of digital transformation, the steps for adaptation to digital transformation, the analysis of failure, the outcomes of digital transformation. The recent evolutions related to digital transformation is evident in different aspects of business. The most recent observed changes in businesses are required skills of employees, organisational culture, business models, and customer relationship management practices.Publisher's Versio The aspirations to reduce environmental impact, the ongoing labor shortages, and the expanding possibilities of digital technologies urge logistics companies to reinvent their network designs, their methods of operating, and even their business models.

We identify an impending transformation in the business model of innovative food distributors that may change the landscape of food distribution in cities PT Penjaminan Infrastruktur Indonesia (Persero)/Indonesia Infrastructure Guarantee Fund (IIGF) is very aware of the important role of digital technology in collaborating both with internal and external stakeholders. The use of digital technology effectively will speed up the process of collaboration both within IIGF and expanded by digital collaboration with external stakeholders. In this final project will explore how to develop a digital transformation strategy at IIGF by studying literature on digital innovation theories, digital transformation, business model transformation, business process transformation and cultural/organizational transformation. The research method in this final project by identifying business issues, analyzing the status quo with interviews, analyzing factors related to digital transformation, formulating effective digital transformation strategies and providing recommendations for business solutions that can be pursued by the management of IIGF, implementation plan of digital transformation more effective. Based on the findings in this study, the results are that we provide business solutions within 3 main elements in digital transformation, namely people, processes and technology. Keywords: Indonesia Infrastructure Guarantee Fund, PT PII (Persero), Government Guarantee, PPP, Digital Transformation Strateg Digital transformation is an important and omnipresent topic for corporations that want to stay relevant and survive in today’s business environment. The success of digital transformation depends on a multitude of factors, one of which is digital transformation governance. This study investigates the moderating effect of CIO membership in the top management team on the relationship between enabling factors of digital transformation and digital transformation success. Furthermore, different digital transformation governance configurations are investigated regarding their effect on the success of digital transformation. We make use of a large scale, multi-national survey among manufacturing firms to answer these two research questions. With our study, we demonstrate the importance of including the CIO in the top management team to take advantage of existing resources and capabilities. Additionally, we show that firms with a CIO being responsible for digital transformation perform significantly better in their digital transformation endeavors The digital transformation of manufacturing enterprises is in full swing. In practice, they often face the problems of resource constraints, lack of digital capability and changing environment, which leads to the dilemma of digital transformation. This paper uses the exploratory case study method to construct the strategic construct of digital transformation of manufacturing enterprises: The process of transforming enterprise strategy by applying digital technology under the leadership of senior management is an all-around transformation of enterprise organizational structure, operating process, business model and value creation mode. Case studies define the core concepts of this paper and discover the direct role of digital transformation strategy on digital innovation performance, the mediating role of resource patchwork and the mediating role of digital empowerment. Based on the results of case analysis and existing literature and theories, the research hypothesis is proposed and verified by empirical research. The results show that: (1) digital transformation strategy positively affects digital product and service innovation, performance and digital process innovation performance; (2) Environmental dynamics positively moderates the relationship between digital transformation strategy and digital process innovation performance, but has no significant positive moderating effect on the relationship between digital transformation strategy and digital product and service innovation performance. (3) Resource patchwork plays a partial mediating role between digital transformation strategy and innovation performance of digital products and services This book presents a collection of papers revealing the impact of advanced computation and instrumentation on healthcare. It highlights the increasing global trend driving innovation for a new era of multifunctional technologies for personalized digital healthcare. Moreover, it highlights that contemporary research on healthcare is performed on a multidisciplinary basis comprising computational engineering, biomedicine, biomedical engineering, electronic engineering, and automation engineering, among other areas A new issue is ready and the world is still trapped in the pandemic of COVID19. Many of us work from home, at least partially. Traveling, especially in an international context, is restricted. Performing research and providing education is challenging. Although we aim for physical distancing only, social distancing is one of the negative effects of the measures implemented to reduce the spread of the virus and its mutants.  On the other hand, a crisis like the COVID-19 pandemic, also opens new chances. For example, the digital transformation of our societies gets a real push and might help us to develop a more sustainable behaviour. Videoconferences are now fully accepted, beneficial effects of remote teaching become visible, and thus in the future we will be better able to evaluate if travels are really needed. The digital transformation also affects our glass research – and this will definitely continue: Digital image processing is used in the paper of Dix et al. for the evaluation of anisotropy effects in pre-stressed glass; Drass et al. use semantic segmentation with deep learning for the detection of cracks at cut edges of flat glass, Hayez et al. give design rules for silicone joints in cold bent glass based on numerical simulations. The other papers in the current issue focus on the glass itself and material combinations with glass. Pauli et al. perform experimental and numerical investigations on glass fragments to derive a material model which in the future might be used to enhance post-fracture models for laminated glass, Brokmann et al. revisit the well-known problem of subcritical crack growth as a function of the environmental conditions, Joachim et al. perform testing of a novel combination of materials in composite panels made of glass and fibre-reinforced plastics and finally Götzinger et al. show first results of a new type of glass laminates adding paper as an interlayer. Stay healthy and keep reading our journal - especially if you are trapped at home Literature in digital transformation maturity is scarce. Digital transformation in higher education, especially after COVID-19 is seen as inevitable. This research explores digital transformation maturity and challenges within Higher Education. The significance of this study stems from the role digital transformation plays in today’s knowledge economy. This study proposes a new framework based on Deloitte’s 2019 digital transformation assessment framework with Petkovic 2014 mega and major higher education process mapping. The study triangulates the findings of multiple research instruments, including survey, interviews, case study, and direct observation. The research findings show a significant variance between the respondents’ perception of digital transformations maturity levels, and the core requirements of digital transformation maturity. The findings also show the lack of holistic vision, digital transformation competency, and data structure and processing as the leading challenges of digital transformation This study examines digital transformation-oriented priorities and practices in Turkish higher education. While digital technologies are gaining importance in every field with Industry 4.0, the business-human-technology relationship has entered the digital transformation process in a broader and systematic framework. Many digital technologies, such as blockchain, big data, artificial intelligence, and the Internet of Things, have occurred in almost all sectors. While the digital transformation process, accelerated by the fourth industrial revolution (Industry 4.0), increases the use and functionality of technology, digital technologies have become indispensable parts of individual and social life. While the digital transformation process increases the need for human resources with digital skills, digital technologies, which have gained importance with digitalization, have also led to the development of new professions. The digital transformation process has affected higher education as well as all sectors. Many digital-dimensional applications such as blockchain, metaverse, and digital twin, where digital technologies gain prominence in higher education, have begun to take their place. Turkish higher education also has a strategic role in the digital transformation process, training human resources, developing education and career relations, and university-industry cooperation. Implementing digital transformation-focused programs in Turkish higher education and training human resources sensitive to the digital economy has become more critical than ever in the digitalizing world. In this context, the first part of the study examines the concept of digital transformation and higher education. The second part reviews Turkish higher education's digital transformation goals and practices Incumbent businesses need to accelerate their digital transformation due to disruption from digital technologies, competition, behavioural changes, regulation, and pandemics. Nevertheless, many digital transformation investments have failed due to poor governance. Previous research has identified the hybrid of traditional and agile-adaptive IT governance mechanisms that influence digital transformation. However, it is important to measure the extent of mechanisms’ influence on organizational performance. Therefore, online survey data from 338 Indonesian banking and insurance respondents have been collected and analysed using the SEM-PLS. The results show that hybrid IT governance mechanisms have moderate influences on digital transformation, and digital transformation strongly influences organizational performance. The study contributes to research by analysing the effect of hybrid IT governance mechanisms on organizational performance, fully mediated by digital transformation. In practical terms, the measurement items from the hybrid IT governance mechanisms, digital transformation and organizational performance dimensions can be useful for guiding digital transformation journeys Cognitive Hyperconnected Digital Transformation provides an overview of the current Internet of Things (IoT) landscape, ranging from research, innovation and development priorities to enabling technologies in a global context. It is intended as a standalone book in a series that covers the Internet of Things activities of the IERC-Internet of Things European Research Cluster, including both research and technological innovation, validation and deployment. The book builds on the ideas put forward by the European Research Cluster, the IoT European Platform Initiative (IoT-EPI) and the IoT European Large-Scale Pilots Programme, presenting global views and state-of-the-art results regarding the challenges facing IoT research, innovation, development and deployment in the next years. Hyperconnected environments integrating industrial/business/consumer IoT technologies and applications require new IoT open systems architectures integrated with network architecture (a knowledge-centric network for IoT), IoT system design and open, horizontal and interoperable platforms managing things that are digital, automated and connected and that function in real-time with remote access and control based on Internet-enabled tools. The IoT is bridging the physical world with the virtual world by combining augmented reality (AR), virtual reality (VR), machine learning and artificial intelligence (AI) to support the physical-digital integrations in the Internet of mobile things based on sensors/actuators, communication, analytics technologies, cyber-physical systems, software, cognitive systems and IoT platforms with multiple functionalities. These IoT systems have the potential to understand, learn, predict, adapt and operate autonomously. They can change future behaviour, while the combination of extensive parallel processing power, advanced algorithms and data sets feed the cognitive algorithms that allow the IoT systems to develop new services and propose new solutions. IoT technologies are moving into the industrial space and enhancing traditional industrial platforms with solutions that break free of device-, operating system- and protocol-dependency. Secure edge computing solutions replace local networks, web services replace software, and devices with networked programmable logic controllers (NPLCs) based on Internet protocols replace devices that use proprietary protocols. Information captured by edge devices on the factory floor is secure and accessible from any location in real time, opening the communication gateway both vertically (connecting machines across the factory and enabling the instant availability of data to stakeholders within operational silos) and horizontally (with one framework for the entire supply chain, across departments, business units, global factory locations and other markets). End-to-end security and privacy solutions in IoT space require agile, context-aware and scalable components with mechanisms that are both fluid and adaptive. The convergence of IT (information technology) and OT (operational technology) makes security and privacy by default a new important element where security is addressed at the architecture level, across applications and domains, using multi-layered distributed security measures. Blockchain is transforming industry operating models by adding trust to untrusted environments, providing distributed security mechanisms and transparent access to the information in the chain. Digital technology platforms are evolving, with IoT platforms integrating complex information systems, customer experience, analytics and intelligence to enable new capabilities and business models for digital business Purpose- This study aims to examine how digitalization has affected and changed higher education. It focuses on the current situation of universities and their current processes and what they need to do to become digital. It aims to present a roadmap for universities to integrate and organize these important changes into their strategies by examining the digital transformation that affects the vision of universities. Methodology- The study employs a literature review using secondary data analysis. Findings- The analysis reveals that the role of universities in many aspects such as society and economy has changed and is expected to change disruptively over the next decade. Universities need to make a differentiation through emerging business models in such a competitive higher education sector. Higher education institutions have to adapt to technological changes for sustainabilty. The pandemic dramatically accelerated the pace of technological adoption worldwide. The drivers of digital transformation in universiteis can be summarized as the increase compteteiveness, user experience and agility while reduction in operating expenses. Conclusion- It may be concluded that a university should be part of present technological trends and include digitalization in their strategies to be competitive in the future. Universities need to focus mainly on exploring more innovative measures to create technology development centres through research to deal with skills shortages. Universities should support those academics who lead the improvement of digital skills and innovative teaching methods, promote digital literacy in the academia and encourage the use of learning platforms. It is important to set a clear policy to adopt digital age in higher education. Universities will be competing globally for students, academic staff and funding. Adoption and implementation of new technologies in universities are inevitable.Publisher's Versio Although digital transformation offers a number of opportunities for today’s organizations, information systems scholars and practitioners struggle to grasp what digital transformation really is, particularly in terms of how it differs from the well-established concept of information technology (IT)-enabled organizational transformation. By integrating literature from organization science and information systems research with two longitudinal case studies—one on digital transformation, the other on IT-enabled organizational transformation—we develop an empirically grounded conceptualization that sets these two phenomena apart. We find that there are two distinctive differences: (1) digital transformation activities leverage digital technology in (re)defining an organization’s value proposition, while IT-enabled organizational transformation activities leverage digital technology in supporting the value proposition, and (2) digital transformation involves the emergence of a new organizational identity, whereas IT-enabled organizational transformation involves the enhancement of an existing organizational identity. We synthesize these arguments in a process model to distinguish the different types of transformations and propose directions for future research Around 70% of companies fail to successfully implement a digital transformation (DT) (Forth, et al. 2020, 1). This study examines the critical success factors (SFs) of a DT. Existing academic views on the SFs of a DT are reviewed and then compared with the results of primary research. Six key clusters of a DT are identified, each containing several SFs. Furthermore, action steps are examined to provide practical guidance to companies. It was found that the experts’ perceptions and experiences are broadly consistent with the derived academic perspectives. However, some SFs seem to be more important than others Digital innovation facilitates digital transformation of companies. Companies which conduct digital innovation can have and sustain competitive advantages in the market place. Digital product innovation, digital process innovation and digital business model innovation are major types of digital innovation. The purpose of this paper is to highlight the concept of digital innovation, explain its types and focus on its advantages for companies. Digital innovation is using information and communication technology (ICT) to create new and improved products, processes, business models, marketing and organizational methods and network. It has three main types namely digital product innovation, digital process innovation and digital business model innovation. Its advantages can be summarized as reducing costs, improving productivity and relationships with stakeholders, and increasing competitive advantages, market share, sales and profits Digital transformation is an inevitability in the era of society 5.0. This study examined the digital transformation of Islamic education of Pesantren in Madura. This study employed qualitative approach, focusing on social education. The study was conducted using interview techniques for Kiai, santri,&nbsp; and researchers in Madura. There were three social facts in the digital transformation of Islamic education. First, the digital transformation in Kiai Pesantren Madura Perspective. Second, implementation of digital transformation of Islamic education at Pesantren Madura. Third, opportunities and challenges for pesantren in facing digital transformation in Islamic education. The Kiai in Pesantren Madura who initially practiced traditional Islamic education were following the development of digital transformation. The positive response can be seen from their perspective on the digital transformation of Islamic education and its implementation in facing digital transformation. Also, some Pesantren have prepared digital literacy facilities and human resources. Even though they have great opportunities in implementing digital transformation, they have the challenge of limited human resources and facilities.Transformasi digital merupakan keniscayaan di era masyarakat 5.0.

d7a4b168-3d1a-46df-aa45-831cb044a56d	smart city	Global trends towards urbanisation are associated with wide-ranging challenges and opportunities for cities. Smart technologies create new opportunities for a range of smart city development and regeneration programmes designed to address the environmental, economic and social challenges concentrated in cities. Whilst smart city programmes have received much publicity, there has been much less discussion about evaluation of smart city programmes and the measurement of their outcomes for cities. Existing evaluation approaches have been criticised as non-standard and inadequate, focusing more on implementation processes and investment metrics than on the impacts of smart city programmes on strategic city outcomes and progress.  To examine this, the SmartDframe project conducted research on city approaches to the evaluation of smart city projects and programmes, and reporting of impacts on city outcomes. This included the ‘smarter’ UK cities of Birmingham, Bristol, Manchester, Milton Keynes and Peterborough. City reports and interviews with representative local government authorities informed the case study analysis. The report provides a series of smart city case studies that exemplify contemporary city practices, offering a timely, insightful contribution to city discourse about best practice approaches to evaluation and reporting of complex smart city projects and programmes Modern cities are embracing cutting-edge technologies to improve the services they offer to the citizens from traffic control to the reduction of greenhouse gases and energy provisioning. In this chapter, we look at the energy sector advocating how Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) and signal processing techniques can be integrated into next generation power grids for an increased effectiveness in terms of: electrical stability, distribution, improved communication security, energy production, and utilization. In particular, we deliberate about the use of these techniques within new demand response paradigms, where communities of prosumers (e.g., households, generating part of their electricity consumption) contribute to the satisfaction of the energy demand through load balancing and peak shaving. Our discussion also covers the use of big data analytics for demand response and serious games as a tool to promote energy-efficient behaviors from end users The smart and resilient city evolves by slow procedures of mutation without radical changes, increasing the livability of its territory. The value of the city center in a Smart City can increase through urban lighting systems: its elements on the territory can collect and convey data to increase services to city users; the electrical system becomes the so-called Smart Grid. This paper presents a study of smart lighting for a small town, a touristic location inside a nature reserve on the Italian coast. Three different approaches have been proposed, from minimal to more invasive interventions, and their effect on the territory has been investigated. Based on street typology and its surroundings, the work analyzes the opportunity to introduce smart and useful services for the citizens starting from a retrofitting intervention. Smart city capabilities are examined, showing how it is possible to provide new services to the cities through ICT (Information and Communication Technology) without deep changes and simplifying the control of basic city functions. The results evidence an important impact on annual energy costs, suggesting smart grid planning not only for metropolis applications, but also in smaller towns, such as the examined one Notions of the Smart City are pervasive in urban development discourses. Various frameworks for the development of smart cities, often conceptualized as roadmaps, make a number of implicit claims about how smart city projects proceed but the legitimacy of those claims is unclear. This paper begins to address this gap in knowledge. We explore the development of a smart transport application, MotionMap, in the context of a £16M smart city programme taking place in Milton Keynes, UK. We examine how the idealized smart city narrative was locally inflected, and discuss the differences between the narrative and the processes and outcomes observed in Milton Keynes. The research shows that the vision of data-driven efficiency outlined in the roadmaps is not universally compelling, and that different approaches to the sensing and optimization of urban flows have potential for empowering or disempowering different actors. Roadmaps tend to emphasize the importance of delivering quick practical results. However, the benefits observed in Milton Keynes did not come from quick technical fixes but from a smart city narrative that reinforced existing city branding, mobilizing a growing network of actors towards the development of a smart region. Further research is needed to investigate this and other smart city developments, the significance of different smart city narratives, and how power relationships are reinforced and constructed through them Purpose: This paper investigates the mutually advantageous value-driven innovations brought by Universities as a key actor in the development of innovation exploiting Smart City opportunities. The final aim is to under-stand the role, tasks and contribution of Universities in Smart City pro-jects. Methodology: The study followed an exploratory and qualitative meth-odology and consisted of 44 in-depth semi-structured interviews with Smart City experts. The choice of the respondents was adjusted to approve the direct and indirect effect of developing the smart ecosystem in various organizational multistakeholder environments. Results: The study found three main areas in which Universities may con-tribute to Smart City projects: a) knowledge/technology creation and transfer; b) social/societal involvement; c) ecosystem facilita-tor/networking.Implications: This paper offers several implications for different stake-holders such as policy makers, Universities’ top managers and firms. Impli-cations for policy managers imply the change in the approach to consumers because most of them do not understand why they need smart solutions. Moreover, it highlights that bureaucracy and lack of an innovative mental-ity kill smart city projects, so the governmental structures should be wired first. Finally, it calls for a huge financial platform (incentives and new fi-nancial mechanisms) and legal changes (legal frameworks should be aligned with peculiarities of Smart Cities).Implications for top managers of Universities are related to the rethink of Universities in smart city innovation ecosystems with the possibility to play an active role. Implications for MNEs and SMEs include that Univer-sities may help in understanding the opportunities around Smart City initi-atives (there is often opacity on the return of investments). At the same time, Universities may help in dealing with public governments and local stakeholders (public and private) Global trends towards urbanisation are associated with wide-ranging challenges and opportunities for cities. Smart technologies create new opportunities for a range of smart city development and regeneration programmes designed to address the environmental, economic and social challenges concentrated in cities. Whilst smart city programmes have received much publicity, there has been much less discussion about the evaluation and measurement of smart city programme outcomes. Existing evaluation approaches have been criticised as non-standard and inadequate, focusing more on implementation processes and investment metrics than on city outcomes and the impacts of smart city programmes. Addressing this, the SmartDframe project aimed to examine city approaches to the evaluation of smart city projects and programmes and reporting of their impacts on city outcomes. A number of ‘smarter’ UK cities were invited to participate, with agreement by city authorities from Birmingham, Bristol, Manchester, Milton Keynes and Peterborough to be interviewed about their smart city work. The findings provide a series of smart city case studies that exemplify contemporary city practices, offering a timely, insightful contribution to city discourse about existing and best practice approaches to evaluation and reporting of complex smart city projects and programmes In a rapidly changing socio-technical environment cities are increasingly seen as main drivers for change. Against this backdrop, this paper studies the emerging Urban Living Lab and Smart City concepts from a project based perspective, by assessing a series of five Smart City initiatives within one local city ecosystem. A conceptual and analytical framework is used to analyse the architecture, nature and outcomes of the Smart City Ghent and the role of Urban Living Labs. The results of our analysis highlight the potential for social value creation and urban transition. However, current Smart City initiatives face the challenge of evolving from demonstrators towards real sustainable value. Furthermore, Smart Cities often have a technological deterministic, project-based approach, which forecloses a sustainable, permanent and growing future for the project outcomes. ‘City-governed’ Urban Living Labs have an interesting potential to overcome some of the identified challenges	['8054632', '43469724', '30333159', '8080179', '43351819', '8061614', '31245803']	[[{'name': 'Caird, Sally'}, {'name': 'Hudson, Lorraine'}, {'name': 'Kortuem, Gerd'}], [{'name': 'Bonetto, Riccardo'}, {'name': 'Rossi, Michele'}], [{'name': 'Bisegna, Fabio'}, {'name': 'Burattini, Chiara'}, {'name': 'Cellucci, Lucia'}, {'name': 'DE LIETO VOLLARO, Andrea'}, {'name': 'Drakou, DIONYSIA AIKATERINI'}, {'name': 'Golasi, Iacopo'}, {'name': 'Gugliermetti, Franco'}, {'name': 'Salata, Ferdinando'}], [{'name': 'Alan-Miguel Valdez'}, {'name': 'Albino V'}, {'name': 'Bakıcı T'}, {'name': 'Bell S'}, {'name': 'Berkhout F'}, {'name': 'Boltanski L'}, {'name': 'Borup M'}, {'name': 'Braun V'}, {'name': 'Cairns S'}, {'name': 'Carvalho M'}, {'name': 'Clapson M'}, {'name': 'Cordella A'}, {'name': 'Deakin M'}, {'name': 'd’Aquin M'}, {'name': 'Edwards M'}, {'name': 'European Platform for Intelligent Cities'}, {'name': 'Finnegan R'}, {'name': 'Franklin J'}, {'name': 'Gooch D'}, {'name': 'Greenfield A'}, {'name': 'Hienerth C'}, {'name': 'Hollands RG'}, {'name': 'Hollands RG'}, {'name': 'Jasanoff S'}, {'name': 'Kitchin R'}, {'name': 'Lee JH'}, {'name': 'Llewelyn-Davies W'}, {'name': 'Martinez-Balleste A'}, {'name': 'Matthew Cook'}, {'name': 'Miles MB'}, {'name': 'Neirotti P'}, {'name': 'Phaal R'}, {'name': 'Pink S'}, {'name': 'Shapiro JM'}, {'name': 'Shelton T'}, {'name': 'Stephen Potter'}, {'name': 'Söderström O'}, {'name': 'Townsend AM'}, {'name': 'Velaga NR'}, {'name': 'Vilajosana I'}, {'name': 'Von Hippel E'}, {'name': 'Wiig A'}], [{'name': 'Belyaeva, Z.'}, {'name': 'Ferraris, A.'}], [{'name': 'Caird, S.'}, {'name': 'Hudson, L.'}, {'name': 'Kortuem, G.'}], [{'name': 'Baccarne, Bastiaan'}, {'name': 'De Marez, Lieven'}, {'name': 'Mechant, Peter'}, {'name': 'Schuurman, Dimitri'}]]	['A Tale of Evaluation and Reporting in UK Smart Cities', 'Smart Grid for the Smart City', 'Urban lighting project for a small town: comparing citizens and authority benefits', 'Roadmaps to Utopia: Tales of the Smart City', 'Universities multistakeholder contribution to smart city ecosystem development', 'Communication on Smart City Evaluation and Reporting In UK cities: Pilots, Demos and Experiments Case', 'The role of urban living labs in a smart city']	exploratory	7

Issue presented: Under the Lanham Act, does the use of trademarked terms in keyword advertising result in infringement when there is evidence of actual confusion The R package frailtySurv for simulating and fitting semi-parametric shared frailty models is introduced. Package frailtySurv implements semi-parametric consistent estimators for a variety of frailty distributions, including gamma, log-normal, inverse Gaussian and power variance function, and provides consistent estimators of the standard errors of the parameters' estimators. The parameters' estimators are asymptotically normally distributed, and therefore statistical inference based on the results of this package, such as hypothesis testing and confidence intervals, can be performed using the normal distribution. Extensive simulations demonstrate the flexibility and correct implementation of the estimator. Two case studies performed with publicly available datasets demonstrate applicability of the package.

Issue presented: Under the Lanham Act, does the use of trademarked terms in keyword advertising result in infringement when there is evidence of actual confusion We propose a method for predicting the 3D shape of a deformable surface from a single view. By contrast with previous approaches, we do not need a pre-registered template of the surface, and our method is robust to the lack of texture and partial occlusions. At the core of our approach is a {\it geometry-aware} deep architecture that tackles the problem as usually done in analytic solutions: first perform 2D detection of the mesh and then estimate a 3D shape that is geometrically consistent with the image. We train this architecture in an end-to-end manner using a large dataset of synthetic renderings of shapes under different levels of deformation, material properties, textures and lighting conditions. We evaluate our approach on a test split of this dataset and available real benchmarks, consistently improving state-of-the-art solutions with a significantly lower computational time.Comment: Accepted at CVPR 201 The recently introduced continuous Skip-gram model is an efficient method for learning high-quality distributed vector representations that capture a large number of precise syntactic and semantic word relationships. In this paper we present several extensions that improve both the quality of the vectors and the training speed. By subsampling of the frequent words we obtain significant speedup and also learn more regular word representations. We also describe a simple alternative to the hierarchical softmax called negative sampling. An inherent limitation of word representations is their indifference to word order and their inability to represent idiomatic phrases. For example, the meanings of "Canada" and "Air" cannot be easily combined to obtain "Air Canada". Motivated by this example, we present a simple method for finding phrases in text, and show that learning good vector representations for millions of phrases is possible Exhibits from the un-sealed joint appendix for Rosetta Stone Ltd., v.

e003133a-b719-4eb0-b185-cf6015ff9fe6	metabolism	The circadian system orchestrates metabolism in daily 24-hour cycles. Such rhythms organize metabolism by temporally separating opposing metabolic processes and by anticipating recurring feeding-fasting cycles to increase metabolic efficiency. Although animal studies demonstrate that the circadian system plays a pervasive role in regulating metabolism, it is unclear how, and to what degree, circadian research in rodents translates into humans. Here, we review evidence that the circadian system regulates glucose, lipid, and energy metabolism in humans. Using a range of experimental protocols, studies in humans report circadian rhythms in glucose, insulin, glucose tolerance, lipid levels, energy expenditure, and appetite. Several of these rhythms peak in the biological morning or around noon, implicating earlier in the daytime is optimal for food intake. Importantly, disruptions in these rhythms impair metabolism and influence the pathogenesis of metabolic diseases. We therefore also review evidence that circadian misalignment induced by mistimed light exposure, sleep, or food intake adversely affects metabolic health in humans. These interconnections among the circadian system, metabolism, and behavior underscore the importance of chronobiology for preventing and treating type 2 diabetes, obesity, and hyperlipidemia Metabolism displays striking and robust regularities in the forms of modularity and hierarchy, whose composition may be compactly described. This renders metabolic architecture comprehensible as a system, and suggests the order in which layers of that system emerged. Metabolism also serves as the foundation in other hierarchies, at least up to cellular integration including bioenergetics and molecular replication, and trophic ecology. The recapitulation of patterns first seen in metabolism, in these higher levels, suggests metabolism as a source of causation or constraint on many forms of organization in the biosphere.   We identify as modules widely reused subsets of chemicals, reactions, or functions, each with a conserved internal structure. At the small molecule substrate level, module boundaries are generally associated with the most complex reaction mechanisms and the most conserved enzymes. Cofactors form a structurally and functionally distinctive control layer over the small-molecule substrate. Complex cofactors are often used at module boundaries of the substrate level, while simpler ones participate in widely used reactions. Cofactor functions thus act as "keys" that incorporate classes of organic reactions within biochemistry.   The same modules that organize the compositional diversity of metabolism are argued to have governed long-term evolution. Early evolution of core metabolism, especially carbon-fixation, appears to have required few innovations among a small number of conserved modules, to produce adaptations to simple biogeochemical changes of environment. We demonstrate these features of metabolism at several levels of hierarchy, beginning with the small-molecule substrate and network architecture, continuing with cofactors and key conserved reactions, and culminating in the aggregation of multiple diverse physical and biochemical processes in cells.Comment: 56 pages, 28 figure Indexación: Scielo; Web of Science.In primary producers, diverse stressors cause an over-production of methylglyoxal (MG), which is principally detoxified by glyoxalase I (GLO1) activity. A recent proteomic study found that GLO1 was up-regulated during natural desiccation in the red seaweed Pyropia orbicularis, which inhabits the upper intertidal rocky zone and compared to other species, is highly tolerant to air exposure. To better understand and determine differential responses to desiccation stress, this study evaluated MG concentration and GLO1 activity in two species with contrasted vertical distribution, P. orbicularis and Lessonia spicata (lower distribution). Results showed that P. orbicularis successfully scavenges MG via increased GLO1 activity during desiccation. In contrast, GLO1 activity in L. spicata did not increase during desiccation, resulting in MG overproduction. This study is the first to quantify MG and GLO1 levels in seaweeds during natural stress, and partly explain the mechanisms by which P. orbicularis is dominant in the upper rocky intertidal zone.http://ref.scielo.org/tp4sn Listado     • Evaluación de la mujer hirsuta.  Edgard Nessim Dayan   •    Falla Ovárica Incipiente (FOI) - Envejecimiento Ovárico Prematuro (EOP, Early Ovarian Ageing).  Fabio Sánchez Escobar          Abstract Relations among nutrients affect the plant nutrition, promoting growth and yield of crops. Therefore, this study aimed to determine the influence of the relationships among foliar nutrients on the yield of four clones of fine cocoa (Theobroma cacao L., two clones self-incompatible, TSH-565 and ICS-39, and two self-compatible, CCN51and ICS-95. Different doses of fertilization were applied to determine which one of this nutrient ratio affect more the yield. A complete randomized block design with five treatments and four replications was used; CT (control), treatments T1, T2, T3 and T4 successively showed increments of NPK, respectively of 25%, 50%, 75% and 100% . Results showed differences in nutrient concentration in leaf under the clone influence , treatment and interaction clone treatment; the clone effect on P, Mg2+, B, Mn2+ and Zn2+; the treatment effect in all nutrients and interaction effect clone*treatment in N, P, Mg2+, B, Fe2+, Mn2+ and Zn2+; this indicates that the applied fertilizer levels influencing the availability and absorption of nutrients. Overall all clones had affinity for Mg2+, S2+and P; in different order of preference for N, K+, Ca2+ and the minor elements for Mn2+, Fe2+, Zn2+, Na+, B and Cu2+, except TSH-565. From the sixty six relationship among nutrients studied at the foliar level, it was found that the relationships among nutrients that showed better association to the yield were: N/Mg, N/P, N/S, N/K, the first two had positive effect and the remainder showed negative effect on yield. Keywords: Clone self-incompatible, clone self-compatible, fertilization, plant nutrition, Theobroma cacao. Resumen Las relaciones entre nutrientes afectan la nutrición de las plantas, favoreciendo el crecimiento y el rendimiento. Esta investigación tuvo como objetivo determinar la influencia de las relaciones entre nutrientes a nivel foliar, sobre el rendimiento de cuatro clones de cacao fino (Theobroma cacao L.), dos clones autoincompatibles, TSH-565-ICS-39, y dos autocompatibles, CCN-51-ICS-95. Se aplicaron diferentes dosis de fertilización para determinar cuál de estas relaciones afecta más el rendimiento, para ello se utilizó un diseño en bloques completos al azar con cinco tratamientos (TC (control), T1, T2, T3, y T4) consistentes en incrementos sucesivos de NPK, respectivamente de 25%, 50%, 75% y 100% sobre el tratamiento control (TC) y cuatro repeticiones. Los resultados muestran diferencias en la concentración de nutrientes a nivel foliar por influencia del clon, tratamiento e interacción clon*tratamiento; por efecto del clon en P, Mg 2+ , B, Mn 2+ y Zn 2+ ; por efecto del tratamiento en todos los nutrientes y por efecto de la interacción clon*tratamiento en N, P, Mg 2+ , B, Fe 2, Mn 2+ y Zn 2+ ; lo cual indica que los niveles de fertilización aplicados influyen en la disponibilidad y absorción de nutrientes. En general todos los clones presentan afinidad por Mg 2+ , S, P; en diferente orden de preferencia por N, K + , Ca 2+ y en los elementos menores, por Mn 2+ , Fe 2+ , Zn 2+ , Na + , B y Cu 2+ . De las sesenta y seis relaciones entre nutrientes estudiadas a nivel foliar, se encontró que las relaciones que más se asocian con el rendimiento son: N/Mg, N/P, N/S, N/K; las primeras dos tienen efecto positivo y el resto efecto negativo sobre el rendimiento.

This was achieved by grafting mercaptopropyltrimethoxysilane onto PVC, followed by aminopropyltriethoxysilane. Betaine and dodecenyl succinic anhydride (DDSA) were bonded to free amine groups. The modified PVC samples were characterized by FT-IR, showing that the PVC surface was successfully coated. Energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy showed the spatial distributions of the elements Si and S, indicating that the coatings were homogeneous. Betaine and DDSA coated PVC showed a better antibacterial performance than the controls. This antibacterial effect was extremely reinforced in betaine-DDSA modified PVC showing greater antibacterial activity than both treatments separately applied. Antibacterial activity against Acinetobacter baumannii, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus, and Bacillus subtilis was studied in the treated samples showing that the coating was effective against Gram positive and Gram negative species.Fil: Villanueva, María Emilia.

The three most common forms of osteoarticular involvement are sacroiliitis, spondylitis, and peripheral arthritis. The molecular mechanisms implicated in bone damage have been recently elucidated. B. abortus induces bone damage through diverse mechanisms in which TNF-α and the receptor activator of nuclear factor kappa-B ligand (RANKL)-the natural modulator of bone homeostasis are involved. These processes are driven by inflammatory cells, like monocytes/macrophages, neutrophils, Th17 CD4+ T, and B cells. In addition, Brucella abortus has a direct effect on osteoarticular cells and tilts homeostatic bone remodeling. These bacteria inhibit bone matrix deposition by osteoblasts (the only bone cells involved in bone deposition), and modify the phenotype of these cells to produce matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) and cytokine secretion, contributing to bone matrix degradation. B. abortus also affects osteoclasts (cells naturally involved in bone resorption) by inducing an increase in osteoclastogenesis and osteoclast activation; thus, increasing mineral and organic bone matrix resorption, contributing to bone damage. Given that the pathology induced by Brucella species involved joint tissue, experiments conducted on synoviocytes revealed that besides inducing the activation of these cells to secrete chemokines, proinflammatory cytokines and MMPS, the infection also inhibits synoviocyte apoptosis. Brucella is an intracellular bacterium that replicates preferentially in the endoplasmic reticulum of macrophages. The analysis of B. abortus-infected synoviocytes indicated that bacteria also replicate in their reticulum suggesting that they could use this cell type for intracellular replication during the osteoarticular localization of the disease. Finally, the molecular mechanisms of osteoarticular brucellosis discovered recently shed light on how the interaction between B. abortus and immune and osteoarticular cells may play an important role in producing damage in joint and bone.Fil: Giambartolomei, Guillermo Hernan.

With the aim to produce mucoadhesive polymeric micelles for drug administration by mucosal routes, chitosan-g-oligo(epsilon-caprolactone) copolymers were synthesized by the microwave-assisted ring-opening polymerization of epsilon-caprolactone using chitosan as the macroinitiator and methanesulfonic acid as the solvent, catalyst and protecting group of the amine moieties. The reaction was conducted under very mild conditions and was completed within 10 min with a monomer conversion above 90%. The grafting of oligo(epsilon-caprolactone) blocks to the free hydroxyl groups of chitosan was confirmed by ATR/FT-IR, 1H- and 13C-NMR, WAXD and thermal analysis (TGA/DSC). The molecular weight of the synthetic hybrid copolymers was determined by GPC and MALDI-ToF mass spectrometry. Polymeric micelles obtained by the solvent diffusion/evaporation method showed a spherical shape (TEM and AFM) with sizes between 111 and 154 nm and highly positive zeta potential (>+50 mV) (DLS). In addition, they displayed good cell compatibility in the human lung adenocarcinoma epithelial line, A549, and were readily up-taken by the cervical cancer cell line, HeLa. Results from the encapsulation of the antituberculosis drug, rifampicin, showed that the micelles had better performance than other nanocarriers previously investigated (e.g., cyclodextrins). Moreover, the micelles conserved the mucoadhesiveness displayed by pristine chitosan and are expected to transiently open tight cell junctions and lead to more prolonged residence times in mucosal tissues and greater drug bioavailability.Fil: Glisoni, Romina Julieta.

We compared treatment with liraglutide monotherapy and dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitor monotherapy in patients with untreated type 2 diabetes( T2DM).Methods:This study included 40 outpatients with untreated T2DM who were randomized to receive liraglutide (0.9 mg/day, n=24) or DPP-4 inhibitors (n=16:sitagliptin, 50 mg/day) as initial treatment for 6 months. Glycemic control, urinalysis, blood pressure, body weight, lipid levels, vascular endothelial function, and inflammatory factors were assessed before and after treatment.Results:Significant improvement was observed in HbA1c and fasting blood glucose levels after treatment in both groups;improvements in the liraglutide group were significantly better than in the sitagliptin group. Only the liraglutide group demonstrated significant improvements in blood pressure, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels, urinary albumin excretion, flow-mediated dilatation, and high-sensitivity C-reactive protein levels. Linear regression analysis demonstrated a significant negative relation between change in flow-mediated dilatation and high-sensitivity C-reactive protein levels.Conclusion:Liraglutide provided significant glycemic control and improved blood pressure, lipid levels, endothelial function, and inflammatory factors in untreated T2DM. In addition to its impact on blood glucose levels, liraglutide may have beneficial effects on the cardiovascular system in patients with T2DM Smart or stimuli-responsive materials are an emerging class of materials used for tissue engineering and drug delivery. A variety of stimuli (including temperature, pH, redox-state, light, and magnet fields) are being investigated for their potential to change a material’s properties, interactions, structure, and/or dimensions. The specificity of stimuli response, and ability to respond to endogenous cues inherently present in living systems provide possibilities to develop novel tissue engineering and drug delivery strategies (for example materials composed of stimuli responsive polymers that self-assemble or undergo phase transitions or morphology transformations). Herein, smart materials as controlled drug release vehicles for tissue engineering are described, highlighting their potential for the delivery of precise quantities of drugs at specific locations and times promoting the controlled repair or remodeling of tissues.Fil: Municoy, Sofia.

Instituto de Química y Metabolismo del Fármaco; Argentin Perilipin 2, also known as Adipose differentiation-relation protein or PLIN2, is a lipid droplet-binding protein present in almost every tissue. The absence of PLIN2 upregulates hepatic very low-density lipoprotein secretion, relieves hepatosteatosis, and improves whole body insulin resistance in mice. Despite of the importance in mediating lipid metabolism, the regulation of PLIN2 itself remains largely unknown. Previous reports have shown that X-box binding protein 1 (XBP1) is an important regulator of lipogenesis. XBP1 is a transcription factor that recognizes and binds to a consensus sequence, 5’-TGACGTGG-3’. Interestingly, when we looked through the promoter region of mouse Plin2 gene, we found that the consensus sequence is present in the Plin2 promoter. Therefore, we hypothesize that XBP1 might directly bind to Plin2 promoter and regulate the Plin2 expression. To test our hypothesis, we will perform the luciferase assay to examine whether the Plin2 promoter activity is regulated by XBP1. We first designed forward and reverse PCR primers, which include BglII and BamHI restriction enzyme sites respectively, to amplify the Plin2 promoter region (from -1100 to +40). We performed PCR and cloned the Plin2 promoter to a TA vector. The TA vector was then sequenced to exclude any point mutations. After sequencing, we sub cloned the Plin2 promoter into a vector containing a luciferase reporter. In the future, we will transfect 293T, a human embryonic kidney cell line, with the Plin2 promoter-luciferase vector we generated. We will compare the Plin2 promoter activity by measuring the luminescence in the presence or absence of XBP1	['54943850', '4213944', '38989266', '146411747', '100794381', '41008822', '40928244',

e3bde13c-2e70-4c8c-a8ec-2595bc090323	calculator	During the last 50 years, humanity's Ecological Footprint has increased by nearly 190% indicating a growing unbalance in the human-environment relationship, coupled with major environmental and social changes. Our ability to live within the planet's biological limits requires not only a major re-think in how we produce and distribute 'things', but also a shift in consumption activities. Footprint calculators can provide a framing that communicates the extent to which an individual's daily activities are compatible with our One Planet context. This paper presents the findings from the first international study to assess the value of personal Footprint calculators in guiding individuals towards sustainable consumption choices. It focuses specifically on Global Footprint Network's personal Footprint calculator, and aims to understand the profile of calculator users and assess the contribution of calculators to increasing individual awareness and encouraging sustainable choices. Our survey of 4245 respondents show that 75% of users resided in 10 countries, 54% were aged 18–34 years and had largely used the calculator within an educational context (62%). The calculator was considered a valuable tool for knowledge generation by 91% of users, and 78% found it useful to motivate action. However, only 23% indicated the calculator provided them with the necessary information to make actual changes to their life and reduce their personal Footprint. The paper discusses how and why this personal Footprint calculator has been effective in enhancing individuals' understanding of the environmental impact of their actions, framing the scale of the problem and empowering users to understand the impacts of different lifestyle choices. Those individual-level and system-level changes needed to generate global sustainability outcomes are also discussed. Similar to other calculators, a gap is also identified in terms of this calculator facilitating individuals to convert new knowledge into action The personal technology of the graphics calculator is presently the only one likely to be available widely enough to influence curriculum design and implementation on a large scale. The algebra curriculum of the past is overburdened with symbolic manipulation at the expense of understanding for most students. But algebra is much more than just symbolic manipulation. Connections between some aspects of algebra: expressing generality, functions, equations and advanced algebra and some graphics calculator capabilities are briefly described. It is suggested that these kinds of connections need to be taken into account in developing the algebra curriculum as well as in classroom teaching Background Studies have demonstrated that the current US guidelines based on American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association (ACC/AHA) Pooled Cohort Equations Risk Calculator may underestimate risk of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease ( CVD ) in certain high-risk individuals, therefore missing opportunities for intensive therapy and preventing CVD events. Similarly, the guidelines may overestimate risk in low risk populations resulting in unnecessary statin therapy. We used Machine Learning ( ML ) to tackle this problem. Methods and Results We developed a ML Risk Calculator based on Support Vector Machines ( SVM s) using a 13-year follow up data set from MESA (the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis) of 6459 participants who were atherosclerotic CVD-free at baseline. We provided identical input to both risk calculators and compared their performance. We then used the FLEMENGHO study (the Flemish Study of Environment, Genes and Health Outcomes) to validate the model in an external cohort. ACC / AHA Risk Calculator, based on 7.5% 10-year risk threshold, recommended statin to 46.0%. Despite this high proportion, 23.8% of the 480 "Hard CVD " events occurred in those not recommended statin, resulting in sensitivity 0.76, specificity 0.56, and AUC 0.71. In contrast, ML Risk Calculator recommended only 11.4% to take statin, and only 14.4% of "Hard CVD " events occurred in those not recommended statin, resulting in sensitivity 0.86, specificity 0.95, and AUC 0.92. Similar results were found for prediction of "All CVD " events. Conclusions The ML Risk Calculator outperformed the ACC/AHA Risk Calculator by recommending less drug therapy, yet missing fewer events. Additional studies are underway to validate the ML model in other cohorts and to explore its ability in short-term CVD risk prediction This lesson introduces students to the concept of ecological footprint, the overall impact of an individual on the environment. Topics include how ecological footprints are calculated, how individual footprints translate to entire nations or to the Earth, and the connection between ecological footprint and biodiversity. The students will consult some online resources on ecological footprint and use an online claculator to determine their individual fooprints, make some comparisons, and examine how making some changes in their consumption would reduce their footprints. Educational levels: Undergraduate lower division, High school A circular computer and system is disclosed for determining the sun angle relative to the horizon from any given place and at any time. The computer includes transparent, rotatably mounted discs on both sides of the circular disc member. Printed on one side of the circular disc member are outer and inner circular sets of indicia respectively representative of site longitude and Greenwich Mean Time. Printed on an associated one of the rotatable discs is a set of indicia representative of Solar Time. Printed on the other side of the circular disc member are parallel lines representative of latitude between diametral representations of North and South poles. Elliptical lines extending between the North and South poles are proportionally disposed on the surface to scale Solar Time in hours Stress calculator permits speedy conversion of strain data directly into maximum and minimum stresses and also determines stress direction. The calculator has a movable slide with logarithmic and linear scales, and an information and grid board. Its size is flexible for easy manipulation The LU-model for fuzzy numbers has been introduced in [4] and applied to fuzzy calculus in [9]; in this paper we build an LU-fuzzy calculator, in order to explain the use of the LU-fuzzy representation and to show the advantage of the parametrization. The calculator produces the basic fuzzy calculus: the arithmetic operations (scalar multiplication, addition, subtraction, multiplica- tion, division) and the fuzzy extension of many univariate functions (power with integer positive or negative exponent, exponential , logarithm, general power function with numeric or fuzzy exponent, sin, arcsin, cos, arccos, tan, arctan, square root, Gaussian and standard Gaussian functions, hyperbolic sinh, cosh, tanh and inverses, erf error function and complementary erfc error function, cu- mulative standard normal distribution). The use of the calculator is illustrated.Fuzzy Sets, LU-fuzzy Calculator, Fuzzy Calculus This document describes the exposure time calculator for the Wide-Field Infrared Survey Telescope (WFIRST) high-latitude survey. The calculator works in both imaging and spectroscopic modes. In addition to the standard ETC functions (e.g. background and S/N determination), the calculator integrates over the galaxy population and forecasts the density and redshift distribution of galaxy shapes usable for weak lensing (in imaging mode) and the detected emission lines (in spectroscopic mode).

METHODS: Fourteen patients with SJS were evaluated between 1998 and 1999 at the External Disease and Cornea Service of the Dept. of Ophthalmology of UNIFESP. We used a S.F. 36 questionnaire. The score for the seven subitems was given based on described formula. High scores mean a better life condition. The same questionnaire was repeated 4 times in a 3 months period. RESULTS: The means of the means of the 4 questionnaire values for the 14 patients were decreased in all S.F. 36 subitems (41.04±22.38 for physical aspects, 53.82±22.82 for social aspects, 26.24±22.46 for emotional aspects, 34.95±25.45 for functional aspects, 42.03± 31.85 for pain, 46.33±18.37 for vitality, 46.18±24.83 for mental health and 50.26±16.29 for general health). CONCLUSION: The S.F. 36 questionnaire is an important method to assess physical and emotional aspects of patients with low vision. It allowed us to detect important limitations in patients with SJS. More patients with a larger follow up are necessary to improve our analysis and further evaluate the effects of psychological intervention.OBJETIVO: Avaliar a qualidade de vida dos pacientes portadores de síndrome de Stevens-Johnson. MÉTODOS: Foram avaliados 14 pacientes com SSJ no período de 1998 e 1999 no Setor de Córnea do Departamento de Oftalmologia da UNIFESP. Empregou-se o questionário S. F. 36 - pesquisa em saúde. A pontuação indica melhor condição de saúde. A mesma avaliação foi repetida quatro vezes em intervalo de três meses. RESULTADOS: As médias das médias das 4 avaliações dos 14 pacientes apresentaram importante redução dos seus valores em todos os subitens do S.F. 36 (41,04±22,38 para aspectos físicos, 53,82±22,82 para aspectos sociais, 26,24±22,46 para aspectos emocionais, 34,95±25,45 para capacidade funcional, 42,03±31,85 para dor, 46,33±18,37 para vitalidade, 46,18±24,83 para saúde mental e 50,26±16,29 para saúde geral). CONCLUSÃO: O questionário S.F. 36 representa método adequado de avaliação de aspectos físicos e emocionais em pacientes com baixa de acuidade visual, que nos permitiu detectar comprometimento importante nas funções básicas dos pacientes com SSJ. Mais pacientes com maior tempo de seguimento são necessários para aprimorar a análise de qualidade de vida nesses pacientes e avaliar os efeitos do acompanhamento psicológico.Universidade Federal de São Paulo (UNIFESP) Departamento de Oftalmologia Setor de Psicologia aplicada à OftalmologiaUniversidade Federal de São Paulo (UNIFESP) Departamento de Oftalmologia Setor de Cirurgia ExperimentalUMESPUniversidade Federal de São Paulo (UNIFESP) Depto. de Oftalmologia Setor de Doenças Externas e CórneaUniversidade de Alfenas Residência de OftalmologiaUNIFESP, Depto. de Oftalmologia Setor de Psicologia aplicada à OftalmologiaUNIFESP, Depto. de Oftalmologia Setor de Cirurgia ExperimentalUNIFESP, Depto. de Oftalmologia Setor de Doenças Externas e CórneaSciEL Este vídeo integra o curso Oftalmologia na Atenção Básica à Saúde (2016), aborda as indicações e demonstra a técnica de aplicação de pomada oftálmica	['21746832', '21742020', '21744213', '21742313', '18427754', '21739171', '43419829']	[[{'name': 'Ambrósio Junior, Renato'}, {'name': 'Chamon, Wallace'}, {'name': 'Kara-Junior, Newton'}, {'name': 'Leme, Luiz Eugenio Garcez'}], [{'name': 'Freitas, Denise de'}, {'name': 'Hofling-Lima, Ana Luisa'}, {'name': 'Solari, Helena Parente'}, {'name': 'Sousa, Luciene Barbosa de'}, {'name': 'Yu, Maria Cecília Zorat'}], [{'name': 'Allemann, Norma'}, {'name': 'Berezovsky, Adriana'}, {'name': 'Gouveia, Enéias Bezerra'}, {'name': 'Matte, Guilherme'}, {'name': 'Morales, Maira Saad De Ávila'}, {'name': 'Sallum, Juliana Maria Ferraz'}], [{'name': 'Freitas, Denise de'}, {'name': 'Oliveira, Lauro Augusto de'}, {'name': 'Sousa, Luciene Barbosa de'}, {'name': 'Vieira, Luiz Antônio'}], [{'name': 'Santos Junior, Eduardo Cordeiro'}], [{'name': 'Belfort, Ricardo'}, {'name': 'Franca, Maciel'}, {'name': 'Gomes, José Álvaro Pereira'}, {'name': 'Lobato, Marcelo G.'}, {'name': 'Nogueira, Ruth'}, {'name': 'Souza, Camila B.'}], [{'name': 'Brasil.

e6b29ef1-c002-4619-b3a8-39194ee758d4	gibberellin	The timing of the germination of seeds is highly responsive to inputs from the environment. Temperature plays a key role in the control of germination, with low temperatures acting to stimulate this developmental transition in many species. In Arabidopsis, extensive gene expression changes have been reported at the whole seed level in response to cold, while much less is known about their spatial distribution across the diverse cell types of the embryo. In this study we examined the spatiotemporal patterns of promoter activity and protein abundance for key gibberellic acid (GA) and abscisic acid (ABA) factors which regulate the decision to germinate both during a time course of germination and in response to cold. Low temperature stimulated the spatial relocalization of these factors to the vasculature. The response of these seeds to dormancy-breaking stratification treatments therefore stimulates the distribution of both positive (GA) and negatively acting (ABA) components to this same cell type. This altered spatial pattern persisted following the transfer of seeds to 22°C, as well as after their rehydration, indicating that this alteration is persistent. These observations suggest that the vasculature plays a role in the low temperature-mediated stimulation of germination in this species, while novel cell types are recruited to promote germination in response to stratification During the last two decades, molecular genetic studies and the completion of the sequencing of the Arabidopsis thaliana genome have increased knowledge of hormonal regulation in plants. These signal transduction pathways act in concert through gene regulatory and signalling networks whose main components have begun to be elucidated. Our understanding of the resulting cellular processes is hindered by the complex, and sometimes counter-intuitive, dynamics of the networks, which may be interconnected through feedback controls and cross-regulation. Mathematical modelling provides a valuable tool to investigate such dynamics and to perform in silico experiments that may not be easily carried out in a laboratory. In this article, we firstly review general methods for modelling gene and signalling networks and their application in plants. We then describe specific models of hormonal perception and cross-talk in plants. This sub-cellular analysis paves the way for more comprehensive mathematical studies of hormonal transport and signalling in a multi-scale setting BACKGROUND: Postharvest fruit conservation relies on low temperatures and manipulations of hormone metabolism to maintain sensory properties. Peaches are susceptible to chilling injuries, such as ‘woolliness’ that is caused by juice loss leading to a ‘wooly’ fruit texture. Application of gibberellic acid at the initial stages of pit hardening impairs woolliness incidence, however the mechanisms controlling the response remain unknown. We have employed genome wide transcriptional profiling to investigate the effects of gibberellic acid application and cold storage on harvested peaches. RESULTS: Approximately half of the investigated genes exhibited significant differential expression in response to the treatments. Cellular and developmental process gene ontologies were overrepresented among the differentially regulated genes, whereas sequences in cell death and immune response categories were underrepresented. Gene set enrichment demonstrated a predominant role of cold storage in repressing the transcription of genes associated to cell wall metabolism. In contrast, genes involved in hormone responses exhibited a more complex transcriptional response, indicating an extensive network of crosstalk between hormone signaling and low temperatures. Time course transcriptional analyses demonstrate the large contribution of gene expression regulation on the biochemical changes leading to woolliness in peach. CONCLUSION: Overall, our results provide insights on the mechanisms controlling the complex phenotypes associated to postharvest textural changes in peach and suggest that hormone mediated reprogramming previous to pit hardening affects the onset of chilling injuries. ELECTRONIC SUPPLEMENTARY MATERIAL: The online version of this article (doi:10.1186/s12870-015-0659-2) contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized users Since stem elongation is a gibberellic acid (GA) response, GA inhibitors are commonly used to control plant height in the production of potted ornamentals and bedding plants. In this study, we investigated interfering with GA signaling by using molecular techniques as an alternative approach. We isolated three putative GID1 genes (PhGID1A, PhGID1B and PhGID1C) encoding GA receptors from petunia. Virus-induced gene silencing (VIGS) of these genes results in stunted growth, dark-green leaves and late-flowering. We also isolated the gai mutant gene (gai-1) from Arabidopsis. We have generated transgenic petunia plants in which the gai mutant protein is over-expressed under the control of a dexamethasone-inducible promoter. This system permits induction of the dominant Arabidopsis gai mutant gene at a desired stage of plant development in petunia plants by the application of dexamethasone (Dex). The induction of gai in Dex-treated T1 petunia seedlings caused dramatic growth retardation with short internodes Increased biomass yield and quality are of great importance for the improvement of feedstock for the biorefinery. For the production of bioethanol, both stem biomass yield and the conversion efficiency of the polysaccharides in the cell wall to fermentable sugars are of relevance. Increasing the endogenous levels of gibberellic acid (GA) by ectopic expression of GA20-OXIDASE1 (GA20-OX1), the rate-limiting step in GA biosynthesis, is known to affect cell division and cell expansion, resulting in larger plants and organs in several plant species. In this study, we examined biomass yield and quality traits of maize plants overexpressing GA20-OX1 (GA20-OX1). GA20-OX1 plants accumulated more vegetative biomass than control plants in greenhouse experiments, but not consistently over two years of field trials. The stems of these plants were longer but also more slender. Investigation of GA20-OX1 biomass quality using biochemical analyses showed the presence of more cellulose, lignin and cell wall residue. Cell wall analysis as well as expression analysis of lignin biosynthetic genes in developing stems revealed that cellulose and lignin were deposited earlier in development. Pretreatment of GA20-OX1 biomass with NaOH resulted in a higher saccharification efficiency per unit of dry weight, in agreement with the higher cellulose content. On the other hand, the cellulose-to-glucose conversion was slower upon HCl or hot-water pretreatment, presumably due to the higher lignin content. This study showed that biomass yield and quality traits can be interconnected, which is important for the development of future breeding strategies to improve lignocellulosic feedstock for bioethanol production The phytohormones jasmonate, gibberellin, salicylate, and ethylene regulate an interconnected reprogramming network integrating root development with plant responses against microbes. The establishment of mutualistic ectomycorrhizal symbiosis requires the suppression of plant defense responses against fungi as well as the modification of root architecture and cortical cell wall properties. Here, we investigated the contribution of phytohormones and their crosstalk to the ontogenesis of ectomycorrhizae (ECM) between grey poplar (Populus tremula x alba) roots and the fungus Laccaria bicolor. To obtain the hormonal blueprint of developing ECM, we quantified the concentrations of jasmonates, gibberellins, and salicylate via liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. Subsequently, we assessed root architecture, mycorrhizal morphology, and gene expression levels (RNA sequencing) in phytohormone-treated poplar lateral roots in the presence or absence of L. bicolor. Salicylic acid accumulated in mid-stage ECM. Exogenous phytohormone treatment affected the fungal colonization rate and/or frequency of Hartig net formation. Colonized lateral roots displayed diminished responsiveness to jasmonate but regulated some genes, implicated in defense and cell wall remodelling, that were specifically differentially expressed after jasmonate treatment. Responses to salicylate, gibberellin, and ethylene were enhanced in ECM. The dynamics of phytohormone accumulation and response suggest that jasmonate, gibberellin, salicylate, and ethylene signalling play multifaceted roles in poplar L. bicolor ectomycorrhizal development The Arabidopsis hypocotyl, together with hormone mutants and chemical inhibitors, was used to study the role of auxin iri cell elongation and its possible interactions with ethylene and gibberellin. When wild-type Arabidopsis seedlings were grown on media containing a range of auxin concentrations, hypocotyl growth was inhibited. However, when axr1-12 and 35S-iaaL (which have reduced auxin response and levels, respectively) were grown in the same conditions, auxin was able to promote hypocotyl growth. In contrast, auxin does not promote hypocotyl growth of axr3-1, which has phenotypes that suggest an enhanced auxin response. These results are consistent with the hypothesis that auxin levels in the wild-type hypocotyl are optimal for elongation and that additional auxin is inhibitory. When ethylene responses were reduced using either the ethylene-resistant mutant etr1 or aminoethoxyvinylglycine, an inhibitor of ethylene synthesis, auxin responses were unchanged, indicating that auxin does not inhibit hypocotyl elongation through ethylene. To test for interactions between auxin and gibberellin, auxin mutants were grown on media containing gibberellin and gibberellin mutants were grown on media containing auxin. The responses were found to be the same as wild-type Arabidopsis seedlings in all cases. In addition, 1 muM of the auxin transport inhibitor 1-naphthylphthalmic acid does not alter the response of wild-type seedlings to gibberellin. Double mutants were made between gibberellin and auxin mutants and the phenotypes of these appear additive. These results indicate that auxin and gibberellin are acting independently in hypocotyl elongation. Thus auxin, ethylene, and gibberellin each regulate hypocotyl elongation independently Short periods of cold stress induce male meiotic restitution and diploid pollen formation in Arabidopsis thaliana by specifically interfering with male meiotic cytokinesis. Similar alterations in male meiotic cell division and gametophytic ploidy stability occur when gibberellic acid (GA) signaling is perturbed in developing anthers. In this study, we found that exogenous application of GA primarily induces second division restitution (SDR)-type pollen in Arabidopsis, similar to what cold does. Driven by the close similarity in cellular defects, we tested the hypothesis that cold-induced meiotic restitution is mediated by GA-DELLA signaling. Using a combination of chemical, genetic and cytological approaches, however, we found that both exogenously and endogenously altered GA signaling do not affect the cold sensitivity of male meiotic cytokinesis. Moreover, in vivo localization study using a GFP-tagged version of RGA protein revealed that cold does not affect the expression pattern and abundance of DELLA in Arabidopsis anthers at tetrad stage. Expression study found that transcript of RGA appears enhanced in cold-stressed young flower buds. Since our previous work demonstrated that loss of function of DELLA causes irregular male meiotic cytokinesis, we here conclude that cold-induced meiotic restitution is not mediated by DELLA-dependent GA signaling There are new trends in agriculture to move toward the low input systems with the lower application of chemical fertilizers. To reach this goal, different methods, such as the application of biofertilizers, may be used. So this experiment was conducted in 2010 at a research farm in Arak, Iran, in factorial in the form of a randomized complete block design with three replications and four factors: animal manure (M), Pseudomonas putida (P), Azotobacter chroococcum (A)and Azospirillum lipoferum (Z). Results indicated that manure significantly affected grain yield (P≤0.01); the highest grain yield was achieved in the interaction of manure × Azotobacter × Pseudomonas (4.556 ton/ha). Grain yield was not significantly affected by the microorganisms. Moreover, the four factors of the experiment significantly affected auxin, gibberellin and cytokinin content of plant. Overall, this experiment indicated that desirable yield can be achieved by the application of manure and biofertilizers, in a sustainable  agriculture Abscisic acid (ABA) and gibberellins (GA) are plant hormones which antagonistically mediate numerous physiological processes, and their optimal balance is essential for normal plant development. However, the molecular mechanism underlying ABA and GA antagonism still needs to be determined. Here, we report that ABA- INSENSITIVE 4 (ABI4) is a central factor for GA/ABA homeostasis and antagonism in post-germination stages. ABI4 over-expression in Arabidopsis (OE-ABI4) leads to developmental defects including a decrease in plant height and poor seed production. The transcription of a key ABA biosynthetic gene, NCED6, and of a key GA catabolic gene, GA2ox7, is significantly enhanced by ABI4 over-expression. ABI4 activates NCED6 and GA2ox7 transcription by directly binding to the promoters, and genetic analysis revealed that mutation in these two genes partially rescues the dwarf phenotype of ABI4 overexpressing plants. Consistently, ABI4 overexpressing seedlings have a lower GA/ABA ratio compared to the wild type. We further show that ABA induces GA2ox7 transcription while GA represses NCED6 expression in an ABI4-dependent manner; and that ABA stabilizes the ABI4 protein, whereas GA promotes its degradation. Taken together, these results propose that ABA and GA antagonize each other by oppositely acting on ABI4 transcript and protein levels	['76728200', '4282685', '29556778', '85861788', '31274161', '85869044', '242135', '51492014', '4613094', '30337207']	[[{'name': 'Bassel, George'}, {'name': 'Mitchell, Jack'}, {'name': 'Mukhtar, Nur K.'}], [{'name': 'Bennett, M.

e862c9d9-5bbc-4cb5-bfd0-1a0adcc60971	portraiture	This article underlines the importance of Latin American photography at a time when the visual turn of Hispanism is increasingly evident. At the time of writing, Graciela Iturbide is one of the foremost living photographers in Latin America. This article reengages with Iturbide’s work using notions of photography as witness and drawing on photography scholar Ariella Azoulay’s structure of the civil contract of photography—in addition to concepts from other visual experts—to identify and underline the several fundamental elements to which Iturbide’s photography testifies. To achieve this result, this article studies her first solo visual narrative, Los que viven en la arena Portraits are defined in part by their aim to reveal and represent the inner ‘character’ of a person. Because landscapes are typically viewed as lacking such an ‘inner life,’ one might assume that landscapes cannot be the subject of portraiture. However, the notion of landscape character plays an important role in landscape aesthetics and preservation. In this essay, I argue that landscape artworks can thus share in portraiture’s goal of capturing character, and in doing so present us with essential tools for revealing the often ineffable character of place. I explain the implications of this view for debates about scientific cognitivism in environmental aesthetics, representing the narrative dimension of landscape character and integrity, and appeals to the character of place in historic and environmental preservation This paper presents a close analysis of Steve Pyke’s famous series of portraits of philosophers. By comparing his photographs to other well-known series of portraits and to other portraits of philosophers we will seek a better understanding of the distinctiveness and fittingness of Pyke’s project. With brief nods to Roland Barthes, Jean Baudrillard, G.W.F. Hegel, and Arthur Schopenhauer and an extensive critical investigation of Cynthia Freeland’s ideas on portraiture in general and her reading of Steve Pyke’s portraits in particular, this paper will also aim to make a contribution to the philosophical debate on portraiture The paper deals with the concepts of fragmentation and reconstruction in the field of portraiture. Taking a portrait as a large fragment of information, we look into ways in which it can be optimised and reduced such that it remains valid but becomes more efficient. The paper commences by exploring the concept of the fragment from various facets, including historically, especially from the modernist point of view, and goes forth to investigate various techniques from practices both adjunct and outside of the field of art in order to inform the portraiture process itself on how information can be collected, optimised and presented to the viewer.peer-reviewe Contemporary portraiture in Australia is undergoing a     revolutionary change in response to the growth of new media,     digital imaging and the proliferation of selfies in the     networked-digital age. While the effects of new technologies on     portraiture are undeniable, this thesis argues contemporary     portraiture from the 1990s to 2010s is a synthesis of both     traditional modes of representation and new art forms that is     expanding our understanding of what is a portrait. Some     contemporary portraits have vestiges of Western historic     portraiture conventions—mimesis, physiognomy and     authenticity—while in others the links have become fragile and     contestable. This thesis analyses how contemporary portraiture     extends beyond established portraiture traditions to create     alternate forms of representation in new and unexpected ways. The     study shows contemporary portraiture is becoming increasingly     ambiguous and fragmented in form, style, and subject matter.     Particular attention is paid to how the desire for social     connectedness, that is, being linked up to social media and     linked in to internet sites, and the need to take selfies on     hand-held devices is redefining portraiture. Furthermore, it     examines how the contemporary portrait contributes to changing     perceptions of Australian society, national and cultural     identity, and ideas of selfhood. It also analyses how new media     is disrupting conventional ways of curating and presenting     portraits in the gallery setting offering unparalleled     opportunities for visitor engagement by presenting portraits on     and off the walls. An important distinction made in this thesis,     is the significance of portraits of country that gives rise to an     alternative concept of subjectivity as a visual and spiritual     marker of Indigenous cultural identity. When considered in this     way, Indigenous portraits of country go beyond the Western     concept of individual difference that allows for a more expansive     meaning of portraiture. The outcome of this research study is a     body of knowledge and scholarly discourse on recent developments     in contemporary portraiture and visual culture brought about by a     significant gap in knowledge of the subject Purpose To first articulate and then illustrate a descriptive theoretical model of documentation (i.e., document creation) suitable for analysis of the experiential, first-person perspective.            Design/methodology/approach Three models of documentation in the literature are presented and synthesized into a new model. This model is then used to understand the findings from a phenomenology-of-practice study of the work of seven visual artists as they each created a self-portrait, understood here as a form of documentation.            Findings A number of themes are found to express the first-person experience of art-making in these examples, including communicating, memories, reference materials, taking breaks and stepping back. The themes are discussed with an eye toward articulating what is shared and unique in these experiences. Finally, the themes are mapped successfully to the theoretical model.            Research limitations/implications The study involved artists creating self-portraits, and further research will be required to determine if the thematic findings are unique to self-portraiture or apply as well to art-making, to documentation generally, etc. Still, the theoretical model developed here seems useful for analyzing documentation experiences.            Practical implications As many activities and tasks in contemporary life can be conceptualized as documentation, this model provides a valuable analytical tool for better understanding those experiences. This can ground education and management decisions for those involved.           Originality/value This paper makes conceptual and empirical contributions to document theory and the study of the information behavior of artists, particularly furthering discussions of information and document experience A paper delivered at in the 2017 Colloquia of the Metropolitan Museum of Art.

ef7cbcc5-b6e6-42c5-a1a2-1e4312feecfc	immunologic diseases allergy	Asthma is not a single disease, but an umbrella term for a number of distinct diseases, each of which are caused by a distinct underlying pathophysiological mechanism. These discrete disease entities are often labelled as asthma endotypes. The discovery of different asthma subtypes has moved from subjective approaches in which putative phenotypes are assigned by experts to data-driven ones which incorporate machine learning. This review focuses on the methodological developments of one such machine learning technique-latent class analysis-and how it has contributed to distinguishing asthma and wheezing subtypes in childhood. It also gives a clinical perspective, presenting the findings of studies from the past 5 years that used this approach. The identification of true asthma endotypes may be a crucial step towards understanding their distinct pathophysiological mechanisms, which could ultimately lead to more precise prevention strategies, identification of novel therapeutic targets and the development of effective personalized therapies Helminth parasite infections are associated with a battery of immunomodulatory mechanisms, which impact all facets of the host immune response to ensure their persistence within the host. This broad-spectrum modulation of host immunity has intended and unintended consequences, both advantageous and disadvantageous. Thus the host may benefit from suppression of collateral damage during parasite infection, and from reduced allergic, autoimmune and inflammatory reactions. However, helminth infection can also be detrimental in reducing vaccine responses, increasing susceptibility to co-infection, and potentially reducing tumor immunosurveillance. In this review we will summarize the panoply of immunomodulatory mechanisms used by helminths, their potential utility in human disease, and prospective areas of future research Occupational asthma is the most common form of occupational lung disease in the developed world at the present time. In this review, the epidemiology, pathogenesis/mechanisms, clinical presentations, management, and prevention of occupational asthma are discussed. The population attributable risk of asthma due to occupational exposures is considerable. Current understanding of the mechanisms by which many agents cause occupational asthma is limited, especially for low-molecular-weight sensitizers and irritants. The diagnosis of occupational asthma is generally established on the basis of a suggestive history of a temporal association between exposure and the onset of symptoms and objective evidence that these symptoms are related to airflow limitation. Early diagnosis, elimination of exposure to the responsible agent, and early use of inhaled steroids may play important roles in the prevention of long-term persistence of asthma. Persistent occupational asthma is often associated with substantial disability and consequent impacts on income and quality of life. Prevention of new cases is the best approach to reducing the burden of asthma attributable to occupational exposures.

f28ee9f5-c877-4226-9584-6b4f4ec907c1	chalcopyrite	A first-principles study of the birefringence and the frequency dependent second harmonic generation (SHG) coefficients of the ternary pnictide semiconductors with formula ABC$_2$ (A = Zn, Cd; B = Si, Ge; C = As, P) with the chalcopyrite structures was carried out. We show that a simple empirical observation that a smaller value of the gap is correlated with larger value of SHG is qualitatively true. However, simple inverse power scaling laws between gaps and SHG were not found. Instead, the real value of the nonlinear response is a result of a very delicate balance between different intraband and interband terms.Comment: 13 pages, 12 figure Magmatic sulfide deposits typically occur in ultramafic-mafic systems, however, mineralisation can occur in more intermediate and alkaline magmas. Sron Garbh is an appinite-diorite intrusion emplaced into Dalradian metasediments in the Tyndrum area of Scotland that hosts magmatic Cu-Ni-PGE-Au sulfide mineralisation in the appinitic portion. It is thus an example of magmatic sulfide mineralisation hosted by alkaline rocks, and is the most significantly mineralised appinitic intrusion known in the British Isles. The intrusion is irregularly shaped, with an appinite rim, comprising amphibole cumulates classed as vogesites. The central portion of the intrusion is comprised of unmineralised, but pyrite-bearing, diorites. Both appinites and diorites have similar trace element geochemistry that suggests the diorite is a more fractionated differentiate of the appinite from a common source that can be classed with the high Ba-Sr intrusions of the Scottish Caledonides. Mineralisation is present as a disseminated, primary chalcopyrite-pyrite-PGM assemblage and a blebby, pyrite-chalcopyrite assemblage with significant Co-As-rich pyrite. Both assemblages contain minor millerite and Ni-Co-As-sulfides. The mineralisation is Cu-, PPGE-, and Au-rich and IPGE-poor and the platinum group mineral assemblage is overwhelmingly dominated by Pd minerals; however, the bulk rock Pt/Pd ratio is around 0.8. Laser ablation analysis of the sulfides reveals that pyrite and the Ni-Co-sulfides are the primary host for Pt, which is present in solid solution in concentrations of up to 22 ppm in pyrite. Good correlations between all base and precious metals indicate very little hydrothermal remobilisation of metals despite some evidence of secondary pyrite and PGM. Sulfur isotope data indicate some crustal S in the magmatic sulfide assemblages. The source of this is unlikely to have been the local quartzites, but S-rich Dalradian sediments present at depth. The generation of magmatic Cu-Ni-PGE-Au mineralisation at Sron Garbh can be attributed to post-collisional slab drop off that allowed hydrous, low-degree partial melting to take place that produced a Cu-PPGE-Au-enriched melt, which ascended through the crust, assimilating crustal S from the Dalradian sediments. The presence of a number of PGE-enriched sulfide occurrences in appinitic intrusions across the Scottish Caledonides indicates that the region contains certain features that make it more prospective than other alkaline provinces worldwide, which may be linked the post-Caledonian slab drop off event. We propose that the incongruent melting of pre-existing magmatic sulfides or ‘refertilised’ mantle in low-degree partial melts can produce characteristically fractionated, Cu-PPGE-Au-semi metal bearing, hydrous, alkali melts, which, if they undergo sulfide saturation, have the potential to produce alkaline-hosted magmatic sulfide deposits The  aim  of this  study  was to examineflotation  of  utility  metals  from poor polymetallic  ores  and verify the potential for profitable yields in connection withpotentially economic deposits of non-ferrous metals.The paper describes results in flotation concentrate research to recover copper from polymetallic ore. The polymetallicore from Zlate Hory deposit (Czech Republic) was subjected to crushing, grinding, and  screening  to  prepare  feed  for  separation  with  mesh  size  under  200  microns.  The  heavy  medium separation was performed in tetrabromethane with a density of 2.967 g.cm-3. The float and sink products were obtained and tested for chemical composition. Next, the treated polymetallic ore sample was subjected to flotation. In flotation,various dosages of collector (PAX) and various pH were tested, at which pyrite was depressed. The recovery of metallic copper in the concentrate increased with the collector dose. As the pH of the medium increased, the pyrite content in the concentrate dropped. The lowest contentof pyrite, i.e. 4.01%,was obtained at  pH  10. In  the original  polymetallic  ore,  the  Cu  content  was  0.41%  after subsequent treatment and flotation tests, the Cu content increased to 1.38 % with Cu recovery 86.18% The aim of this paper is the investigation of the role of diagenesis in the transformation of clastic sulfide sediments such as sulfide breccias from the Semenov-3 hydrothermal field (Mid-Atlantic Ridge). The breccias are composed of marcasite\u2013pyrite clasts enclosed in a barite\u2013sulfide\u2013quartz matrix. Primary hydrothermal sulfides occur as colloform, fine-crystalline, porous and radial marcasite\u2013pyrite clasts with inclusions or individual clasts of chalcopyrite, sphalerite, pyrrhotite, bornite, barite and rock-forming minerals. Diagenetic processes are responsible for the formation of more diverse authigenic mineralization including framboidal, ovoidal and nodular pyrite, coarse-crystalline pyrite and marcasite, anhedral and reniform chalcopyrite, inclusions of HgS phase and pyrrhotite\u2013sphalerite\u2013chalcopyrite aggregates in coarse-crystalline pyrite, zoned bornite\u2013chalcopyrite grains, specular and globular hematite, tabular barite and quartz. The early diagenetic ovoid pyrite is enriched in most trace elements in contrast to late diagenetic varieties. Authigenic lower-temperature chalcopyrite is depleted in trace elements relative to high-temperature hydrothermal ones. Trace elements have different modes of occurrence: Se is hosted in pyrite and chalcopyrite; Tl is related to sphalerite and galena nanoinclusions; Au is associated with galena; As in pyrite is lattice-bound, whereas in chalcopyrite it is related to tetrahedrite\u2013tennantite nanoinclusions; Cd in pyrite is hosted in sphalerite inclusions; Cd in chalcopyrite forms its own mineral; Co and Ni are hosted in chalcopyrite This article reports a detailed Raman scattering and microstructural characterization of S-rich CuIn(S,Se)2 absorbers produced by electrodeposition of nanocrystalline CuInSe2 precursors and subsequent reactive annealing under sulfurizing conditions. Surface and in-depth resolved Raman microprobe measurements have been correlated with the analysis of the layers by optical and scanning electron microscopy, x-ray diffraction, and in-depth Auger electron spectroscopy. This has allowed corroboration of the high crystalline quality of the sulfurized layers. The sulfurizing conditions used also lead to the formation of a relatively thick MoS2 intermediate layer between the absorber and the Mo back contact. The analysis of the absorbers has also allowed identification of the presence of In-rich secondary phases, which are likely related to the coexistence in the electrodeposited precursors of ordered vacancy compound domains with the main chalcopyrite phase, in spite of the Cu-rich conditions used in the growth. This points out the higher complexity of the electrodeposition and sulfurization processes in relation to those based in vacuum deposition techniques Pyrite and chalcopyrite mineral samples from Mangampet barite mine, Kadapa, Andhra Pradesh, India are used in the present study. XRD data indicate that the pyrite mineral has a face centered cubic lattice structure with lattice constant 5.4179 Å. Also it possesses an average particle size of 91.9 nm. An EPR study on the powdered samples confirms the presence of iron in pyrite and iron and Mn(II) in chalcopyrite. The optical absorption spectrum of chalcopyrite indicates presence of copper which is in a distorted octahedral environment. NIR results confirm the presence of water fundamentals and Raman spectrum reveals the presence of water and sulfate ions Copper is of such widespread natural occurrence in North America and there are so few metal-mining districts that have not contributed to its production that it is obviously necessary in any brief general treatment of the geology of the copper deposits of the continent to restrict the discussion to the districts in which copper is the dominant metallic product. Otherwise the summary would  be unreasonably long. The copper deposits of North America may be classified in various ways--with respect to form, genesis, geologic age, distribution, and distinctive features of character or occurrence. On the whole, an areal grouping will probably be most satisfactory. To some extent this will coincide with a classification based on the form or character of the deposits, but there will be notable exceptions. Classification, after all, is merely a human-expedient for systematizing description and for facilitating studies of origin. It is essentially artificial and sets up class distinctions, the legality of which, at least so far as ore deposits are concerned, Nature does not recognize	['936774', '37876223', '33001729', '4222387', '51918051', '14065036', '4602271', '78122511']	[[{'name': 'A.

f6c7a8ca-4087-4260-91a0-44c2f7fb9bc6	aging	The aging behavior is investigated for thin films of atactic polystyrene through measurements of complex electric capacitance. During isothermal aging process the real part of the electric capacitance increases with aging time, while the imaginary part decreases with aging time. This result suggests that the aging time dependence of the real and imaginary parts are mainly associated with change in thickness and dielectric permittivity, respectively. In thin films, the thickness depends on thermal history of aging even above the glass transition. Memory and `rejuvenation' effects are also observed in the thin films.Comment: 4 pages, 2 figure Hogg Foundation for Mental Healt Using a local randomized experiment that arises from a sharp discontinuity in Disability Insurance (DI) policy in Norway, we provide transparent and credible identification of how financial incentives induce DI recipients to return to work. We find that many DI recipients have considerable capacity to work that can be effectively induced by providing financial work incentives. We further show that providing work incentives to DI recipients may both increase their disposable income and reduce program costs. Our findings also suggest that targeted policies may be the most effective in encouraging DI recipients to return to work It is now increasingly realized that the underlying mechanisms which govern aging is a complex interplay of genetic regulation and damage accumulation. Aging as a result of accumulation of &#x2018;faults&#x2019; on cellular and molecular levels, has been proposed in the damage (fault)-accumulation theory by Kirkwood 2006. However, this theory fails to explain some aging phenotypes such as fibrosis and premature aging, since terms such as &#x2018;damage&#x2019; and &#x2018;fault&#x2019; are not specified. Therefore we introduce here a specification of the underlying mechanism of aging and arrive at a novel theory: aging of the body is a result of the accumulation of Misrepair of tissue. It emphasizes: a) it is Misrepair, not the original damage, that accumulates and leads to aging; and b) aging can occur at different levels, however aging of the body takes place at least on the tissue level, but not necessarily on cellular/molecular level. The novel concept of Misrepair introduced here unifies the understanding of the roles of environmental damage, repair, gene regulation, and multicellular structure in the aging process. The Misrepair-accumulation theory introduced in the present paper gives explanations for the aging phenotypes, premature aging, and the difference of longevity in different species, and is consistent with the point of view of physical theory of complex systems 1_sm64ucz	['579979', '33903897', '78776856', '74257145', '6723316', '313079', '57010636']	[[{'name': 'Fukao, Koji'}, {'name': 'Koizumi, Hiroki'}], [{'name': 'Adelberg, Bettina'}, {'name': 'Lelong, Jacqueline'}, {'name': 'Smith, Bert Kruger'}], [{'name': 'Parole Preparation Project'}, {'name': 'Release Aging People in Prison Campaign'}], [{'name': 'UNH Center on Aging and Community Living'}], [{'name': 'Kostøl, AR'}, {'name': 'Mogstad, M'}], [{'name': 'Arne Wunderlin'}, {'name': 'Jicun Wang'}, {'name': 'Ravi Mahadeva'}, {'name': 'Thomas Michelitsch'}], [{'name': 'Healthy Aging Lab'}]]	['Aging phenomena in polystyrene thin films', 'Aging Parents & Dilemmas of Their Children', 'New York State Parole Board: Failures in Staffing and Performance', 'Person-Centered Care Provider Tip Sheet', 'How financial incentives induce disability insurance recipients to return to work', 'Aging as a consequence of misrepair -- A novel theory of aging', 'I\'m an international student.

f8a12148-7feb-41c7-a3e8-df5ca659401d	clathrin	Clathrin coat accessory proteins play key roles in transport mediated by clathrin-coated vesicles. Yeast Irc6p and the related mammalian p34 are putative clathrin accessory proteins that interact with clathrin adaptor complexes. We present evidence that Irc6p functions in clathrin-mediated traffic between the trans-Golgi network and endosomes, linking clathrin adaptor complex AP-1 and the Rab GTPase Ypt31p. The crystal structure of the Irc6p N-terminal domain revealed a G-protein fold most related to small G proteins of the Rab and Arf families. However, Irc6p lacks G-protein signature motifs and high-affinity GTP binding. Also, mutant Irc6p lacking candidate GTP-binding residues retained function. Mammalian p34 rescued growth defects in irc6 cells, indicating functional conservation, and modeling predicted a similar N-terminal fold in p34. Irc6p and p34 also contain functionally conserved C-terminal regions. Irc6p/p34-related proteins with the same two-part architecture are encoded in genomes of species as diverse as plants and humans. Together these results define Irc6p/p34 as a novel type of conserved clathrin accessory protein and founding members of a new G protein-like family Apicomplexan parasites are single eukaryotic cells with a highly polarised secretory system that contains unique secretory organelles (micronemes and rhoptries) that are required for host cell invasion. In contrast, the role of the endosomal system is poorly understood in these parasites. With many typical endocytic factors missing, we speculated that endocytosis depends exclusively on a clathrin-mediated mechanism. Intriguingly, in Toxoplasma gondii we were only able to observe the endogenous clathrin heavy chain 1 (CHC1) at the Golgi, but not at the parasite surface. For the functional characterisation of Toxoplasma gondii CHC1 we generated parasite mutants conditionally expressing the dominant negative clathrin Hub fragment and demonstrate that CHC1 is essential for vesicle formation at the trans-Golgi network. Consequently, the functional ablation of CHC1 results in Golgi aberrations, a block in the biogenesis of the unique secretory microneme and rhoptry organelles, and of the pellicle. However, we found no morphological evidence for clathrin mediating endocytosis in these parasites and speculate that they remodelled their vesicular trafficking system to adapt to an intracellular lifestyle Clathrin coats drive transport vesicle formation from the plasma membrane and in pathways between the trans-Golgi network (TGN) and endosomes. Clathrin adaptors play central roles orchestrating assembly of clathrin coats. The yeast clathrin adaptor-interacting protein Irc6 is an orthologue of human p34, which is mutated in the inherited skin disorder punctate palmoplantar keratoderma type I. Irc6 and p34 bind to clathrin adaptor complexes AP-1 and AP-2 and are members of a conserved family characterized by a two-domain architecture. Irc6 is required for AP-1-dependent transport between the TGN and endosomes in yeast. Here we present evidence that the C-terminal two amino acids of Irc6 are required for AP-1 binding and transport function. Additionally, like the C-terminal domain, the N-terminal domain when overexpressed partially restores AP-1-mediated transport in cells lacking full-length Irc6. These findings support a functional role for Irc6 binding to AP-1. Negative genetic interactions with irc6∆ are enriched for genes related to membrane traffic and nuclear processes, consistent with diverse cellular roles for Irc6 Clathrin-mediated endocytosis (CME) is a cellular trafficking process in which cargoes and lipids are internalized from the plasma membrane into vesicles coated with clathrin and adaptor proteins. CME is essential for many developmental and physiological processes in plants, but its underlying mechanism is not well characterized compared with that in yeast and animal systems. Here, we searched for new factors involved in CME in Arabidopsis thaliana by performing tandem affinity purification of proteins that interact with clathrin light chain, a principal component of the clathrin coat. Among the confirmed interactors, we found two putative homologs of the clathrin-coat uncoating factor auxilin previously described in non-plant systems. Overexpression of AUXILIN-LIKE1 and AUXILIN-LIKE2 in Arabidopsis caused an arrest of seedling growth and development. This was concomitant with inhibited endocytosis due to blocking of clathrin recruitment after the initial step of adaptor protein binding to the plasma membrane. By contrast, auxilin-like1/2 loss-of-function lines did not present endocytosis-related developmental or cellular phenotypes under normal growth conditions. This work contributes to the ongoing characterization of the endocytotic machinery in plants and provides a robust tool for conditionally and specifically interfering with CME in Arabidopsis The current model for vesicular traffic to and from the plasma membrane is accepted but the molecular requirements for this coordination are not well defined. We have identified the has1 mutant, which has a stomatal function defect, as a clathrin heavy chain 1 (CHC1) mutant allele and show that it has a decreased rate of endocytosis and growth defects that are shared with other chc1 mutant alleles. We used chc1 alleles and the related chc2 mutant as tools to investigate the effects clathrin defects have on secretion pathways and plant growth. We show that secretion and endocytosis at the plasma membrane is sensitive to CHC1 and CHC2 function in seedling roots, and that chc mutants have physiological defects in stomatal function and plant growth that have not been previously described. These findings suggest that clathrin supports specific functions of multiple cell types. Stomata movement and gas exchange is altered in chc mutants, indicating clathrin is important for stomatal regulation. The aberrant function of chc mutant stomata is consistent with the growth phenotypes observed under different water and light conditions, which are also similar to those of the secretory SNARE mutant, syp121. The syp121 and chc mutants have impaired endo- and exocytosis compared to wild type, indicating a link between SYP121-dependent secretion and clathrin-dependent endocytosis at the plasma membrane. Our findings provide evidence that clathrin and SYP121 functions are important for the coordination of endo- and exocytosis, and have an impact on stomatal function, gas exchange, and vegetative growth in Arabidopsis	['85867703', '7132072', '85867789', '51490810', '44741436']	[[{'name': 'Cascio, Duilio'}, {'name': 'Costaguta, Giancarlo'}, {'name': 'Daboussi, Lydia'}, {'name': 'Gorynia, Sabine'}, {'name': 'Lorenz, Todd C'}, {'name': 'Payne, Gregory S'}], [{'name': 'A Achbarou'}, {'name': 'A Herm-Götz'}, {'name': 'A Sadak'}, {'name': 'AE Radulescu'}, {'name': 'AL Schwartz'}, {'name': 'B Lige'}, {'name': 'B Striepen'}, {'name': 'BF Kafsack'}, {'name': 'BJ Nichols'}, {'name': 'C Agop-Nersesian'}, {'name': 'C Agop-Nersesian'}, {'name': 'C Wang'}, {'name': 'D Van Damme'}, {'name': 'David J.
