Objective: The goal is to show how and why the phenomenological method is very often misused in the sportrelated research. Methods: Interpretation of the key texts, explanation of their meaning. Results: The confrontation of concrete sport-related texts with the original meaning of the key phenomenological notions shows mainly three types of misuse – the confusion of phenomenology with immediacy, with an epistemologically subjectivist stance
          (phenomenalism), and with empirical research oriented towards objects in the world. Conclusions: Many of the discussed authors try to take over the epistemological validity of phenomenology for their research, which itself is not phenomenological, and it seems that this is because they lack such a methodological foundation. The authors believe that an authentically phenomenological analysis of sport is possible, but it must respect the fundamental distinctions that differentiate phenomenology from other styles of thinking In this article I examine the relation between the philosophies of Maurice Merleau-Ponty and Gilles Deleuze by looking at the way they refer to the time theory of Henri Bergson. It appears that, although Merleau-Ponty copies some fundamental Bergsonian insights on the nature of time, he presents himself as a critical reader of the latter. I will show that Merleau-Ponty's interpretation of Bergson differs fundamentally from the one by Deleuze, but that Merleau-Ponty's 'corrections' to Bergson fit Deleuze's reading of Bergson very well. This indicates a similarity with respect to what is at stake in the philosophies of Merleau-Ponty and Deleuze. The critical reference that Deleuze makes to Merleau-Ponty's conception of cinema and thus of movement is hence not justified, but the result of a selective and prototypical reading of the early Merleau-Ponty In this essay I place choreographer Natalie Heller in dialogue with Merleau-Ponty on issues of motor-perception, expression and bodily faith. I analyze her new work First Impressions to demonstrate how she responds to a similar impulse that drove Merleau-Ponty’s phenomenology, particularly in his last writing, The Visible and the Invisible. Both Heller and Merleau-Ponty seek to go beyond the representational understanding of motion and perception in order to articulate and experiment with a type of expression, which is beyond the distinctions between motion and motionlessness, activity and passivity, visibility and invisibility. While Merleau-Ponty writes about this form of expression, Heller’s performers show that beyond these binaries is a form of expression that is ambiguously situated between impressing and being impressed upon, and that to engage the world or the city as such, requires a motor-perceptual form of faith I argue that Merleau-Ponty\u27s phenomenology of lived body experience can be used to enrich Aquinas\u27s integral anthropology. In Chapter One I lay out the possibilities of such an enrichment by examining contemporary philosophers of mind who draw on Aquinas and Merleau-Ponty in strikingly similar ways. Analytical Thomists, as represented by Eric LaRock, and thinkers seeking to integrate neuropsychology and phenomenology, like Ralph Ellis, argue that that the concept of form (taken from Aquinas and Merleau-Ponty respectively) is necessary for properly understanding the human being as an integral unity of intellectual principle and body. I then pose potential objections to my project: 1) that Aquinas\u27s method of syllogistic demonstration and dependence on tradition is not compatible with Merleau-Ponty\u27s use of phenomenological description and insistence that philosophy be grounded in immediate subjective experience; 2) that their basic anthropological terms (e.g. soul, body, consciousness, form) might radically differ; 3) that Merleau-Ponty\u27s phenomenology, if a form of idealism or materialism, might preclude compatibility leading to enrichment. In Chapter Two I outline the broad metaphysical structure of Aquinas\u27s thought and then present his argument that the intellectual soul is form of the body. In Chapter Three I outline Merleau-Ponty\u27s basic philosophical methodology and then present his phenomenological explorations of consciousness (or soul) as form of the body. Chapter Four is devoted to overcoming the objections raised in Chapter One. I argue, for example, that there is a foundation for compatibility between Aquinas and Merleau-Ponty in that both believe perception is the basis for any philosophical knowledge and both appeal to interior experience for concluding that the human being is an integral union of intellectual principle and body. I conclude by arguing that Merleau-Ponty\u27s phenomenological descriptions of lived body experience can enrich Aquinas\u27s philosophical anthropology in at least three ways: 1) they richly illustrate Aquinas\u27s position that the intellectual soul is form of the body; 2) they can offer better practical examples for Aquinas\u27s arguments than he himself provides; 3) they can be used to extend Aquinas\u27s claims regarding the intellect\u27s knowledge of itself"	['8868701', '31344823', '56355455', '69996671']	[[{'name': 'Arnold'}, {'name': 'Bednar'}, {'name': 'Bednar'}, {'name': 'Bergson'}, {'name': 'Bergson'}, {'name': 'Fink'}, {'name': 'Heidegger'}, {'name': 'Heidegger'}, {'name': 'Hogenova'}, {'name': 'Hogeveen'}, {'name': 'Huizinga'}, {'name': 'Husserl'}, {'name': 'Husserl'}, {'name': 'Husserl'}, {'name': 'Husserl'}, {'name': 'Husserl'}, {'name': 'Jirasek'}, {'name': 'Loland'}, {'name': 'Martinkova'}, {'name': 'Martinkova'}, {'name': 'Martinkova'}, {'name': 'Martinkova'}, {'name': 'McLaughlin'}, {'name': 'Merleau-Ponty'}, {'name': 'Merleau-Ponty'}, {'name': 'Merleau-Ponty'}, {'name': 'Merleau-Ponty'}, {'name': 'Merleau-Ponty'}, {'name': 'Nesti'}, {'name': 'Patocka'}, {'name': 'Polit'}, {'name': 'Polkinghorne'}, {'name': 'Standal'}, {'name': 'Stewart'}], [{'name': 'Wambacq, Judith'}], [{'name': 'Merleau-Ponty'}, {'name': 'Merleau-Ponty'}, {'name': 'Merleau-Ponty'}, {'name': 'Merleau-Ponty'}, {'name': 'Merleau-Ponty'}], [{'name': 'Miller, Joshua'}]]	"['Phenomenology is not phenomenalism.

The island state of Mauritius has long been one of India's closest allies in the region. This article discusses India's plans for a military intervention in Mauritius in 1983 to prevent a feared coup that may have threatened India's interests. A naval task force was readied, but the intervention did not proceed because of disagreements in India's leadership. Instead New Delhi facilitated a political solution to the crisis that firmly consolidated its special role. This previously undisclosed episode sheds light on India's thinking about the Indian Ocean, the alignment of India's interests with the United States, and India's military capabilities This paper reports on an ongoing doctoral research project which aims to identify the main barriers to access within the built environment for persons with a visual impairment. The research seeks to investigate whether these barriers are common for all types of visual impairment and degree of vision loss and if so, what inclusive design solutions can accommodate the needs of the majority of visually impaired users. An access audit has been conducted within Glasgow city centre which sought to quantify the number and type of hazards present within a typical built environment. This was followed up by a questionnaire which asked participants to rate factors which may prevent them from making independent visits to their nearest city centre including psychological factors, physical features and obstructions resulting from the presence of street furniture. Participants also indicated the colours and contrasts which they find easiest to detect within the built environment. These findings will be used to inform the creation of a new set of design guidelines to assist designers, architects and urban planners as to how they can provide more accessible and inclusive environments for the visually impaired population C38 In this work, we introduce an online model for communication complexity.
Analogous to how online algorithms receive their input piece-by-piece, our
model presents one of the players, Bob, his input piece-by-piece, and has the
players Alice and Bob cooperate to compute a result each time before the next
piece is revealed to Bob. This model has a closer and more natural
correspondence to dynamic data structures than classic communication models do,
and hence presents a new perspective on data structures.
  We first present a tight lower bound for the online set intersection problem
in the online communication model, demonstrating a general approach for proving
online communication lower bounds. The online communication model prevents a
batching trick that classic communication complexity allows, and yields a
stronger lower bound. We then apply the online communication model to prove
data structure lower bounds for two dynamic data structure problems: the Group
Range problem and the Dynamic Connectivity problem for forests. Both of the
problems admit a worst case $O(\log n)$-time data structure. Using online
communication complexity, we prove a tight cell-probe lower bound for each:
spending $o(\log n)$ (even amortized) time per operation results in at best an
$\exp(-\delta^2 n)$ probability of correctly answering a
$(1/2+\delta)$-fraction of the $n$ queries"	['41260665', '135105330', '4196823', '4219770', '9455100', '42858910']	[[{'name': 'Merkulov, Dmitriy'}, {'name': 'Nikitina, I. P.'}, {'name': 'Pererva, V.

a single view. By contrast with previous approaches, we do not need a
pre-registered template of the surface, and our method is robust to the lack of
texture and partial occlusions. At the core of our approach is a {\it
geometry-aware} deep architecture that tackles the problem as usually done in
analytic solutions: first perform 2D detection of the mesh and then estimate a
3D shape that is geometrically consistent with the image. We train this
architecture in an end-to-end manner using a large dataset of synthetic
renderings of shapes under different levels of deformation, material
properties, textures and lighting conditions. We evaluate our approach on a
test split of this dataset and available real benchmarks, consistently
improving state-of-the-art solutions with a significantly lower computational
time.Comment: Accepted at CVPR 201 The recently introduced continuous Skip-gram model is an efficient method for
learning high-quality distributed vector representations that capture a large
number of precise syntactic and semantic word relationships. In this paper we
present several extensions that improve both the quality of the vectors and the
training speed. By subsampling of the frequent words we obtain significant
speedup and also learn more regular word representations. We also describe a
simple alternative to the hierarchical softmax called negative sampling. An
inherent limitation of word representations is their indifference to word order
and their inability to represent idiomatic phrases. For example, the meanings
of ""Canada"" and ""Air"" cannot be easily combined to obtain ""Air Canada"".

7b18c947-3313-4812-8422-b2e0d435c894	fast fashion	"Two-Part Program activity for Students Fashion Swap Fast fashion, characterized as clothing made quickly and cheaply, can be seen as a solution for consumers who want to participate in current fashion trends at price points they can afford. While creating a solution for consumers, fast fashion creates even greater problems for both the environment and the designers responsible for creating the clothing everyone wants to wear.
In order to keep up with consumer demand for low-cost, trendy items, many fast fashion retailers look to the work of other designers to determine what to create and sell. In doing so, the line between inspiration and imitation may be crossed, with little intellectual property protection in place to protect designers or provide consequences for fast fashion copyists. Once a design enters production, the harm extends to the environment with impacts at each stage of the clothing life cycle.
This Note analyzes the relationship between fast fashion’s environmental destruction and the insufficiency of current intellectual property law in protecting fashion designers from fast fashion copyists. With fast fashion at the root of both issues, this Note argues for a new amendment to the Vessel Hull Design Protection Act following in the footsteps of H.R. 2511 and the Innovative Design Protection and Piracy Prevention Act. In making this argument, this Note further delves into the inadequacies and limitations of current environmental laws and regulations regarding fast fashion production. Finally affording fashion designers the robust intellectual property protection they need will not only deter and decrease production of fast fashion knockoffs, but also reduce fast fashion production—lessening the severe impact of the fast fashion industry on the environment The objective of this thesis is to express a need for sustainability within the fast fashion industry, in the form of cultural movement that acts as alternative to the current means of production, consumption, and philosophies. Sustainability within current popular discourses is often human-centered and lacking authenticity, thus I aim to highlight an alternative that is opposite of that. In doing such, I bring to light the negative effects of the industry through a case study on the fast fashion company SHEIN, who claim to be making sustainable efforts. I analyzed SHEIN’s 2021 Sustainability and Social Impact Report (SSIR), focusing on the disparities between SHEIN’s rhetoric and the actual sustainable efforts being made, to determine their level of authenticity to sustainability. I uncover negative environmental impacts such as high levels of water consumption, ecosystem disruptions, and disposability that result from the materials used, which lead me to believe SHEIN lacks authenticity to their claims at sustainability. To counter these rapidly increasing effects, I highlight a new philosophy of fashion, one that carries sustainable values and practices. Invented by Kate Fletcher, slow fashion, is the cultural movement needed because it distances itself from the need to feed rising consumer consumption rates, moves away from quickly fading fashion trends, and reduces the speed of production. I highlight slow fashion as a cultural movement because the required sustainable change needed must occur on a cultural level, if it is to create impactful changes. I finalize with possible steps that consumers and companies can take, in order to adopt slow fashion as a new mode of fashion.
Key Words: Sustainability, fast fashion, slow fashion, consumer consumption, psychology of consumption, water consumption, ecosystem disruption, philosophy of fashion, rhetoric, and disposability The apparel industry can be divided into two categories, fast fashion, and luxury fashion. It’s no secret that the apparel industry has a negative impact on our world in terms of sustainability, greenwashing, pollution, and human rights issues. Although the entire apparel industry plays a role in this, fast fashion seems to be at the forefront of these issues. It is necessary to understand the growth and consumer obsession with fast fashion in order to grasp its negative impact. In the same way, understanding the importance of luxury fashion to the consumer, along with the strides being made by luxury fashion companies to combat the apparel industry’s lasting and detrimental impact on our environment. By conducting research comparing fast fashion and luxury fashion, vital information will be gained to call attention to this issue. In order to fully understand the comparable differences between fast fashion and luxury fashion, a specific comparison between the luxury fashion company, Gucci, and the fast fashion company, Shein, will be conducted using tangible reports and available company information. To visually express the damage fast fashion has on the environment, a creative advertisement campaign has been created. This advertisement campaign, in theory, is meant to be from a luxury fashion company urging a fast fashion company to become more sustainable. This research and information are meant to serve as a benchmark for further research to be done and will allow for awareness and attention to be brought to the issue while explaining and addressing two vital components in the apparel industry The key purpose of this study is to examine the remarkable context within the evolution of the paradigm innovation in fashion product development, in the case of Japanese fashion apparel, UNIQLO, created by Fast Retailing Corp in 1998. The key theme hereby concerns innovation, and this perspective surely necessitates Fast Retailing's strategic collaboration with a Japanese new material and artificial textile powerhouse, TORAY: as TORAY's technological provision was an essential source for the dynamic product and process innovation behind the extraordinary growth of UNIQLO. Furthermore, the technological superiority also entailed its innovative positioning in market competition. It is crucial to examine how and why the two brought about their core competences together through new combinations of concepts. This should impart a few promising research perspectives regarding their innovative model of unchallenged value creation, strong market competitiveness, and sustainable corporate growth.Paradigm Innovation, Product Development, Business Model, Japanese Apparel Industry, Fashion Apparel, Fast Fashion, Fast Retailing, UNIQLO, TORAY, Alliance, Virtual Vertical Integration Abstract 
The apparel industry has various categories of fashion. One of these categories known more readily today as fast fashion. Fast fashion has gained immense global popularity over the past decade. The concept of fast fashion apparel involves producing vast amounts of product as quick as possible to sell to the consumer at an aggressively low price. It is important to understand this current phenomenon of the global rise of fast fashion as well as understand the devastating effects our environment is facing because of it. As the vocalization of the harmful effects of fast fashion have become more prevalent on various media platforms, the fast fashion industry continues to skyrocket. This begs the research question as to what consumer behaviors are driving to fund this now economic powerhouse? After exploring previous research in Europe regarding fast fashion consumer behavior, the idea of exploring consumer behavior cross culturally regarding fast fashion consumerism developed. By utilizing this previous data obtained through past published research in Europe, an exact replication of this research was done surveying undergraduate students in the United States, specifically at the University of Arkansas. After research was completed by an electronic survey, vital information was gained allowing an analysis between both European fast fashion consumer behavior and American fast fashion consumer behavior. Additionally, this data was used to show results generationally between Millennials respondents (Europe) and Generation Z respondents (U.S). These results will help to gain a further understanding on a multi-cultural examination of fast fashion behavior and the similarities or differences within them. This research is meant to serve as a benchmark in understanding basic purchasing decisions among these consumers to encourage future research in exploring effective ways to change fast fashion funding Fast fashion retail model is being adopted by various fashion retailers through execution of short buying cycle and limited supply of fashion apparel and accessories (Byun & Sternquist, 2011). It has become increasingly important for fashion retailers to capitalize on rapid inventory turnover to attract the fashion consumers. Previous studies have tested the impact of three fast fashion factors low price, perceived perishability and scarcity on the in store hoarding (Byun & Sternquist, 2008). However, there are limited studies that explore impacts of fast fashion factors on the buying attitudes and intentions of fast fashion consumers"	['122281267', '46360998', '158506557', '40068739', '159447891', '2495183', '158732302', '61677088']	[[{'name': 'Katehis-Krencik, Chloe'}], [{'name': 'Ledezma, Victoria'}], [{'name': 'Krzeminski, Julia'}], [{'name': 'Millward-Pena, Isabel Agatha'}], [{'name': 'Illum, Danielle L'}], [{'name': 'Choi, Eugene K.'}], [{'name': 'Feuerbacher, Madison R'}], [{'name': 'Bennur, Shubhapriya'}, {'name': 'Gao, Xiuyuan'}]]	['Fast Fashion', 'Globalization and Fashion: Too Fast, Too Furious', 'Slowing Down Fast Fashion: How Improved Intellectual Property Law Can Protect Designers and Promote Sustainability', 'FROM FAST FASHION TO SUSTAINABLE SLOW FASHION', 'Fast Fashion, Luxury Fashion, and Their Sustainability Efforts', 'Paradigm Innovation through the Strategic Collaboration between TORAY & UNIQLO : Evolution of A New Fast Fashion Business Model', 'The Extreme Rise of the Fast Fashion Industry from Country to Country: Does Consumer Behavior Differ Cross Culturally Regarding Fast Fashion between The United States and European Countries?', 'Exploring impacts of fast fashion factors on consumer intentions to shop at fast fashion stores']	8.0	exploratory	0.5

The rising cost of living and inflation are resulting in households struggling with financial management. This has implications on the quality of life and economic mobility. Early motivation for and the utilisation of financial management tools can alleviate the risk of spiralling debt. In this paper, we present the case for a gamified collaborative financial management tool. We explain how current research has focused on individuals yet households often have shared and interweaving finances which would benefit from collaborative tools. We articulate the importance of motivation in financial administration and discuss the potential of gamification to motivate households in the proactive management of finances. In this regard, we describe the results of conducting a survey to investigate the case for gamification in household financial management. Our findings suggest that gamification may offer new ways to motivate household financial management and can help households manage their exposure to debt “Beyond Government Performance: Is Planning and Management Enough?”   17th Annual Conference of the Association for Budgeting and Financial Management a section of the American Society for Public Administration

Washington D Current practice largely follows restrictive approaches to market risk measurement, such as historical simulation or RiskMetrics. In contrast, we propose flexible methods that exploit recent developments in financial econometrics and are likely to produce more accurate risk assessments, treating both portfolio-level and asset-level analysis. Asset-level analysis is particularly challenging because the demands of real-world risk management in financial institutions - in particular, real-time risk tracking in very high-dimensional situations - impose strict limits on model complexity. Hence we stress powerful yet parsimonious models that are easily estimated. In addition, we emphasize the need for deeper understanding of the links between market risk and macroeconomic fundamentals, focusing primarily on links among equity return volatilities, real growth, and real growth volatilities. Throughout, we strive not only to deepen our scientific understanding of market risk, but also cross-fertilize the academic and practitioner communities, promoting improved market risk measurement technologies that draw on the best of both.Market risk, volatility, GARCH"	['42880821', '148542365', '12361354', '2512286']	[[{'name': 'Butt , Prins'}, {'name': 'Sievenpiper , Michael'}], [{'name': 'Association for Budgeting and Financial Management'}], [], [{'name': 'Francis X.

1e6eedbc-5b6f-49c1-ad5b-c0bd87beca27	taverne	The osteology of Rhinopycnodus gabriellae gen. and sp. nov., a pycnodontiform fish from the marine Cenomanian (Late Cretaceous) of Lebanon, is studied in detail. This new fossil genus belongs to the family Pycnodontidae, as shown by the presence of a posterior brush-like process on its parietal. Its long and broad premaxilla, bearing one short and very broad tooth is the principal autapomorphy of this fish. Within the phylogeny of Pycnodontidae, Rhinopycnodus occupies an intermediate position between Ocloedus and Tepexichthys Given that: (1) the worldwide consumption of antimicrobial drugs (AMDs) used in food-producing animals will increase over the coming decades; (2) the prudent use of AMDs will not suffice to stem the rise in human antimicrobial resistance (AMR) of animal origin; (3) alternatives to AMD use are not available or not implementable, there is an urgent need to develop novel AMDs for food-producing animals. This is not for animal health reasons, but to break the link between human and animal resistomes. In this review we establish the feasibility of developing for veterinary medicine new AMDs, termed green antibiotics, having minimal ecological impact on the animal commensal and environmental microbiomes.We first explain why animal and human commensal microbiota comprise a turnstile exchange, between the human and animal resistomes. We then outline the ideal physico-chemical, pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties of a veterinary green antibiotic and conclude that they can be developed through a rational screening of currently used AMD classes.  The ideal drug will be hydrophilic, of relatively low potency, slow clearance and small volume of distribution. It should be eliminated principally by the kidney as inactive metabolite(s). For oral administration, bioavailability can be enhanced by developing lipophilic pro-drugs. For parenteral administration, slow-release formulations of existing eco-friendly AMDs with a short elimination half-life can be developed. These new eco-friendly veterinary AMDs can be developed from currently used drug classes to provide alternative agents to those currently used in veterinary medicine and mitigate animal contributions to the human AMR problem An increasing variety of indicators of antimicrobial usage has become available in human and veterinary medicine, with no consensus on the most appropriate indicators to be used. The objective of this review is therefore to provide guidance on the selection of indicators, intended for those aiming to quantify antimicrobial usage based on sales, deliveries or reimbursement data. Depending on the study objective, different requirements apply to antimicrobial usage quantification in terms of resolution, comprehensiveness, stability over time, ability to assess exposure and comparability. If the aim is to monitor antimicrobial usage trends, it is crucial to use a robust quantification system that allows stability over time in terms of required data and provided output; to compare usage between different species or countries, comparability must be ensured between the different populations. If data are used for benchmarking, the system comprehensiveness is particularly crucial, while data collected to study the association between usage and resistance should express the exposure level and duration as a measurement of the exerted selection pressure. Antimicrobial usage is generally described as the number of technical units consumed normalized by the population at risk of being treated in a defined period. The technical units vary from number of packages to number of individuals treated daily by adding different levels of complexity such as daily dose or weight at treatment. These technical units are then related to a description of the population at risk, based either on biomass or number of individuals. Conventions and assumptions are needed for all of these calculation steps. However, there is a clear lack of standardization, resulting in poor transparency and comparability. By combining study requirements with available approaches to quantify antimicrobial usage, we provide suggestions on the most appropriate indicators and data sources to be used for a given study objective The author describes briefly the osteology of the three valid species of the Late Cretaceous genus Chirocentrites. He shows that only the type species, C. coroninii, belongs to this genus. He creates the new genus Heckelichthys for the two other species, C. microdon and C. vexillifer, with the latter as type species. The phylogeny of the Ichthyodectidae is studied. The systematic position of Chirocentrites and Heckelichthys is specified The osteology of Gladiopycnodus karami gen. et sp. nov., of Monocerichthys scheuchzeri gen. et sp. nov. and of Rostropycnodus gayeti gen. et sp. nov., three new fossil fishes from the marine Cenomanian (Late Cretaceous) of Lebanon, is studied in detail. Some of their cranial characters and the presence of a postcoelomic bone clearly refer these fishes to the order Pycnodontiformes. However, they differ from all other described Pycnodontiformes by two important characters. Their snout is elongated as a rostrum, formed by the enlarged prefrontal and the toothless premaxilla, with this premaxilla sutured by its upper margin to the lower margin of the prefrontal. Their pectoral fin is replaced by a strong spine articulated with the cleithrum. These two apomorphies justify the erection of a new family, the Gladiopycnodontidae. The skull of Monocerichthys scheuchzeri sp. nov. does not differ greatly from a classical pycnodontiform skull and this species seems to be the more primitive member of this new family. Gladiopycnodus karami gen. et sp. nov. and Rostropycnodus gayeti gen. et sp. nov. are much more specialized. They share some apomorphies not present in Monocerichthys scheuchzeri gen. et sp. nov., i. e., an extremely long rostrum and an elongated first anal pterygiophore that sustains with the postcoelomic bone a strong and long anal spine. Gladiopycnodontidae fam. nov. and Coccodontidae share a series of apomorphies that justify the erection of a new superfamily, Coccodontoidea, grouping these two families The marine osteoglossid “Brychaetus” caheni from the Lower Paleocene of Cabinda (Africa) is re-studied. It does not belong to the genus Brychaetus because of differences in teeth and premaxilla shape. It is assigned to the new genus Ridewoodichthys on the basis of its caudal skeleton, which differs from that of all other known fossil and Recent Osteoglossidae L’ostéologie et les relations phylogénétiques de trois ichthyodectidés des schistes bitumineux de l’Aptien de Guinée Équatoriale et du Gabon sont étudiés. La première espèce était déjà connue sous le nom de Chirocentrites guinensis. Cette espèce est valable mais son squelette montre qu’elle appartient non pas à Chirocentrites mais à Chiromystus, un genre caractérisé par des rayons pectoraux élargis et branchus et un axe vertébral court. Les différences entre Chiromystus et Cladocyclus sont soulignées pour démontrer la validité de Chiromystus. La deuxième espèce n’est connue que par quelques fragments crâniens, en particulier les mâchoires. Elle est nouvelle et représente un nouveau genre, Africathrissops weileri, qui paraît primitif et proche de Thrissops. Sa fossette d’articulation pour le carré est formée par le rétroarticulaire et l’articulaire sans participation de l’angulaire. La troisième espèce est inédite et représente aussi un nouveau genre, Verraesichthys bloti, caractérisé également par un squelette axial court mais son crâne et sa ceinture scapulaire diffèrent nettement de ceux de Chiromystus. Le squelette caudal d’un ichthyodectidé indéterminé mais évolué est également décrit	['7229907', '10128376', '10128522', '20548665', '7230529', '20548384', '20548339']	[[{'name': 'Capasso, Luigi'}, {'name': 'Taverne, Louis'}], [{'name': 'Adams'}, {'name': 'Aidara-Kane'}, {'name': 'Alvarez'}, {'name': 'Amidon'}, {'name': 'Andersson'}, {'name': 'Andremont'}, {'name': 'Andremont'}, {'name': 'Angulo'}, {'name': 'Ashbolt'}, {'name': 'Baquero'}, {'name': 'Bednorz'}, {'name': 'Bibbal'}, {'name': 'Bonomo'}, {'name': 'Brunton'}, {'name': 'Call'}, {'name': 'Centers for Disease Control and Prevention'}, {'name': 'Chantziaras'}, {'name': 'Chen'}, {'name': 'Cheng'}, {'name': 'Cheng'}, {'name': 'Collignon'}, {'name': 'DANMAP'}, {'name': 'de Jong'}, {'name': 'Dewulf'}, {'name': 'Duse'}, {'name': 'Dutil'}, {'name': 'Edlung'}, {'name': 'European Food Safety Authority'}, {'name': 'European Food Safety Authority'}, {'name': 'European Food Safety Authority'}, {'name': 'European Medicine Agency'}, {'name': 'European Medicines Agency'}, {'name': 'European Medicines Agency'}, {'name': 'Fairbrother'}, {'name': 'Food and Drug Administration'}, {'name': 'Foster'}, {'name': 'Hansen'}, {'name': 'Herrick'}, {'name': 'Heuer'}, {'name': 'Hofmann'}, {'name': 'Hojberg'}, {'name': 'Holman'}, {'name': 'Horowitz'}, {'name': 'Huang'}, {'name': 'Ito'}, {'name': 'Jacobsen'}, {'name': 'Kusama'}, {'name': 'Langlois'}, {'name': 'Lindecrona'}, {'name': 'Lipinski'}, {'name': 'Lipinski'}, {'name': 'Luo'}, {'name': 'Marshall'}, {'name': 'Metz'}, {'name': 'Midtlyng'}, {'name': 'Montanari'}, {'name': 'Naess'}, {'name': 'Nielsen'}, {'name': 'Nord'}, {'name': 'O’Brien'}, {'name': 'O’Connor'}, {'name': 'Panagiotidis'}, {'name': 'Phillips'}, {'name': 'Pijpers'}, {'name': 'Pollet'}, {'name': 'Rashid'}, {'name': 'Rashid'}, {'name': 'Ratz'}, {'name': 'Rioux'}, {'name': 'Roof'}, {'name': 'Rose'}, {'name': 'Sakaeda'}, {'name': 'Sarmah'}, {'name': 'Singer'}, {'name': 'Smith'}, {'name': 'Sparo'}, {'name': 'Stamey'}, {'name': 'Subbiah'}, {'name': 'Takenouchi'}, {'name': 'Taverne'}, {'name': 'Thiele-Bruhn'}, {'name': 'Tolls'}, {'name': 'Toutain'}, {'name': 'Toutain'}, {'name': 'Toutain'}, {'name': 'Toutain'}, {'name': 'Toutain'}, {'name': 'Trobos'}, {'name': 'Van Boeckel'}, {'name': 'van den Bogaard'}, {'name': 'van der Waaij'}, {'name': 'Wellington'}, {'name': 'Whitman'}, {'name': 'World Health Organisation'}, {'name': 'World Health Organisation'}, {'name': 'Yazdankhah'}, {'name': 'Yusof'}, {'name': 'Zhang'}], [{'name': 'A.

While the cryogenic stability and quench propagation are fundamental issues for the design and safe operation of superconducting magnets, there is insufficient understanding and experimental data for 2G HTS conductors, in particular for the high field scenario at low temperature (&lt;77 K) where the current sharing regime is much larger than in low temperature superconductors. The present work includes a systematic characterization of the relevant thermal-electrical properties used for both qualitative discussion and numerical analysis. Direct measurements of one dimensional adiabatic quench initiation and propagation of a stabilizer-free 2G conductor have been carried out with spatial-temporal recording of temperature and voltage following the deposition of varying local heat pulses to the conductor at different temperatures between 30 K and 77 K carrying different transport currents. The minimum quench energy, and the heat generation in the minimum propagation zone (MPZ) have been obtained as a function of temperature and transport current. The results show quench features unique to HTS such as an increasing MPZ with transport current and higher quench energies at lower temperatures. The experimental results are discussed in the context of current sharing over a large temperature range Thin films nanometrology is an emerging field in nanoscience as the synthesis, processing and applications of nanostructured thin films require an in-depth knowledge of their elastic constants. The elastic energy of a surface acoustic wave propagating in a solid medium, is concentrated at the interface between the solid and air (or a sufficiently rarified medium); consequently, high frequency surface acoustic waves with sub-micrometer wavelengths are an extraordinary tool for a qualitative and quantitative elastic characterization of thin films. In this article, a short review is presented to describe the main ultrasound techniques based on surface acoustic waves for thin films characterization and to highlight the probing limits
of acoustic nanometrology Nanoscience and nanotechnology have been described as a research area that integrates many scientific and engineering disciplines. However, the integration of disciplines is so complex that the disciplinarity of nanoscience and nanotechnology remains undefined. As a result, the nanoscience and nanotechnology area is viewed as multidisciplinary, or interdisciplinary science, or even as a separate discipline and there is no consensus regarding its disciplinarity. The previous studies conducted in order to describe the disciplinarity associated with this area have focused mainly on political, institutional and external factors while the cognitive aspects of disciplinarity of nanoscience and nanotechnology are still less understood. As a consequence, what is needed from the curricula and training programmes to ensure the growth of this area is not fully understood. When there are strong predictions about the need for an extensive workforce in the nanoscience and nanotechnology area but the disciplinarity associated with it is less understood, it can have an adverse effect on the future of this area. This research fills the gap by aiming to achieve a greater understanding of the nanoscience and nanotechnology area and its associated disciplinarity. This research focused on examining postgraduate researchers’ experiences of nanoscience and nanotechnology research to explore the disciplinarity, knowledge, skills and competences associated with nanoscience research so that a deeper understanding of this area can be achieved. This research was conducted using hermeneutic interpretive phenomenological methodology to collect and interpret data from twenty five individual semi-structured interviews with postgraduate researchers working in the nanoscience and iii nanotechnology area. The research methodology was influenced by Max van Manen’s ideas of hermeneutic interpretive phenomenology and it was reshaped to best suit the research context and purpose. Examining the researchers’ experiences of nanoscience research made it possible to understand how postgraduate researchers perceive, understand and conduct nanoscience research. Further, the examination portrayed what knowledge, skills and competences the postgraduate researchers have applied when working in this area. The findings from this interpretive study revealed that the postgraduate researchers experienced the nanoscience and nanotechnology area essentially as a ‘boundary spanning’ experience which described their skills of crossing the disciplinary boundaries in order to understand nanoscience research. Furthermore, the researchers experienced mapping, i.e. their research was evaluated and judged by the researchers from other disciplines. The findings also indicated that the nanoscience and nanotechnology research displayed characteristics of both multidisciplinarity and interdisciplinarity and therefore they suggested that promoting any one particular approach and aiming to develop the researchers for either a multidisciplinary or interdisciplinary platform would not be appropriate for this area. The postgraduate researchers needed the skills to work together with researchers from other disciplines and become good at boundary spanning in the nanoscience area. The interpretive findings were taken back to the postgraduate researchers through a quantitative survey and their agreement with the interpretations further enhanced the credibility of this hermeneutic phenomenological study. The hermeneutic phenomenological research gave a new way to explore the complex nanoscience area by examining the postgraduate researchers’ experiences and this research provided an enhanced understanding of the nanoscience and nanotechnology area and its disciplinarity"	['2255760', '759642', '222645', '30338884', '84231083']	"[[{'name': 'George W.

Influenza and Other Respiratory Viruses published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd.Background: Information on vaccine effectiveness in a context of novel variants of concern (VOC) emergence is of key importance to inform public health policies. This study aimed to estimate a measure of comparative vaccine effectiveness between Omicron (BA.1) and Delta (B.1.617.2 and sub-lineages) VOC according to vaccination exposure (primary or booster). Methods: We developed a case–case study using data on RT-PCR SARS-CoV-2-positive cases notified in Portugal during Weeks 49–51, 2021. To obtain measure of comparative vaccine effectiveness, we compared the odds of vaccination in Omicron cases versus Delta using logistic regression adjusted for age group, sex, region, week of diagnosis, and laboratory of origin. Results: Higher odds of vaccination were observed in cases infected by Omicron VOC compared with Delta VOC cases for both complete primary vaccination (odds ratio [OR] = 2.1; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.8 to 2.4) and booster dose (OR = 5.2; 95% CI: 3.1 to 8.8), equivalent to reduction of vaccine effectiveness from 44.7% and 92.8%, observed against infection with Delta, to −6.0% (95% CI: 29.2% to 12.7%) and 62.7% (95% CI: 35.7% to 77.9%), observed against infection with Omicron, for complete primary vaccination and booster dose, respectively. Conclusion: Consistent reduction in vaccine-induced protection against infection with Omicron was observed. Complete primary vaccination may not be protective against SARS-CoV-2 infection in regions where Omicron variant is dominant.publishersversionpublishe Clinical outcome upon infection with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) ranges from silent infection to lethal coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). We have found an enrichment in rare variants predicted to be loss-of-function (LOF) at the 13 human loci known to govern Toll-like receptor 3 (TLR3)- and interferon regulatory factor 7 (IRF7)-dependent type I interferon (IFN) immunity to influenza virus in 659 patients with life-threatening COVID-19 pneumonia relative to 534 subjects with asymptomatic or benign infection. By testing these and other rare variants at these 13 loci, we experimentally defined LOF variants underlying autosomal-recessive or autosomal-dominant deficiencies in 23 patients (3.5%) 17 to 77 years of age. We show that human fibroblasts with mutations affecting this circuit are vulnerable to SARS-CoV-2. Inborn errors of TLR3-and IRF7-dependent type I IFN immunity can underlie life-threatening COVID-19 pneumonia in patients with no prior severe infection The coronavirus is an unprecedented external shock that
is challenging the EU and its member states. The crisis is
fundamental, posing a dramatic threat to public health and
the life of citizens. Everyone is affected by the imposition

There is a need to optimize allocation of treatment and resources in intensive care, as clinically established risk assessments such as SOFA and APACHE II scores show only limited performance for predicting the survival of severely ill COVID-19 patients. Additional tools are also needed to monitor treatment, including experimental therapies in clinical trials. Comprehensively capturing human physiology, we speculated that proteomics in combination with new data-driven analysis strategies could produce a new generation of prognostic discriminators. We studied two independent cohorts of patients with severe COVID-19 who required intensive care and invasive mechanical ventilation. SOFA score, Charlson comorbidity index, and APACHE II score showed limited performance in predicting the COVID-19 outcome. Instead, the quantification of 321 plasma protein groups at 349 timepoints in 50 critically ill patients receiving invasive mechanical ventilation revealed 14 proteins that showed trajectories different between survivors and non-survivors. A predictor trained on proteomic measurements obtained at the first time point at maximum treatment level (i.e. WHO grade 7), which was weeks before the outcome, achieved accurate classification of survivors (AUROC 0.81). We tested the established predictor on an independent validation cohort (AUROC 1.0). The majority of proteins with high relevance in the prediction model belong to the coagulation system and complement cascade. Our study demonstrates that plasma proteomics can give rise to prognostic predictors substantially outperforming current prognostic markers in intensive care.Peer reviewedFinal Published versio Purpose Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) may increase the risk of severe COVID-19; however, the level of potential modulation has not yet been established. The objective of the study was to determine the association between high risk of OSA, comorbidities, and increased risk for COVID-19, hospitalization, and intensive care unit (ICU) treatment. Methods We conducted a cross-sectional population-based web survey in adults in 14 countries/regions. The survey included sociodemographic variables and comorbidities. Participants were asked questions about COVID-19, hospitalization, and ICU treatment. Standardized questionnaire (STOP questionnaire for high risk of OSA) was included. Multivariable logistic regression was conducted adjusting for various factors. Results Out of 26,539 respondents, 20,598 (35.4% male) completed the survey. Mean age and BMI of participants were 41.5 +/- 16.0 years and 24.0 +/- 5.0 kg/m(2), respectively. The prevalence of physician-diagnosed OSA was 4.1% and high risk of OSA was 9.5%. We found that high risk of OSA (adjusted odds ratio (aOR) 1.72, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.20, 2.47) and diabetes (aOR 2.07, 95% CI: 1.23, 3.48) were associated with reporting of a COVID-19 diagnosis. High risk for OSA (aOR 2.11, 95% CI: 1.10-4.01), being male (aOR: 2.82, 95% CI: 1.55-5.12), having diabetes (aOR: 3.93, 95% CI: 1.70-9.12), and having depression (aOR: 2.33, 95% CI: 1.15-4.77) were associated with increased risk of hospitalization or ICU treatment. Conclusions Participants at high risk of OSA had increased odds of having COVID-19 and were two times more likely to be hospitalized or treated in ICU.Peer reviewe We  are  facing  an  unprecedented  challenge  of  containing  the  coronavirus,  and  the  fear  and uncertainty that it is spreading.

The FDC Initiative on Digital Reality felt there is a need to look at the Digital Transformation from the
point of view of a profound change that is pervading the entire society—a change made possible by
technology and that keeps changing due to technology evolution opening new possibilities but is also a
change happening because it has strong economic reasons. The direction of this change is not easy to
predict because it is steered by a cultural evolution of society, an evolution that is happening in niches
and that may expand rapidly to larger constituencies and as rapidly may fade away. This creation,
selection by experimentation, adoption, and sudden disappearance, is what makes the whole scenario
so unpredictable and continuously changing.The amount of literature on Digital Transformation is staggering—and it keeps growing. Why, then,
come out with yet another such document? Moreover, any text aiming at explaining the Digital
Transformation by presenting a snapshot is going to become obsolete in a blink of an eye, most likely to
be already obsolete at the time it is first published.

challenges and opportunities this presents for practice and for policy. The paper is based on one of

eight 'digital R&D' projects supported by NESTA, Arts Council England and the AHRC, designed to

analyse the effects of digital innovation in UK arts organisations.



The paper focuses on a series of residencies in three UK arts organisations. The research aims to

identify the cultural conditions which support or prevent short-term digital innovation becoming

'embedded' in the ongoing practice of a cultural organisation. The paper considers differing practices,

attitudes and expectations between creative technologists and arts organisations. These differing

'cultures of innovation' may help us to understand why digital innovations often fail to move beyond

temporary and pragmatic problem-solving towards more challenging, transformational effects on

organisational strategy and culture Digital transformation is a relatively new concept in the university library environment and has become one of the key concepts of success and sustainability for university libraries in the competitive information environment. Based on the reviews conducted on the subject literature, no research was found that could present the construction requirements and the factors affecting the digital transformation of university libraries. Therefore, the purpose of the current research was to identify the components of the digital transformation of university libraries.

The approach of this research was qualitative and the Sandelowski and Barroso's seven-step meta-synthesis method (2007) has been used. The statistical population of the research includes all the scientific publications related to the foundations and dimensions of the digital transformation of university libraries, counting the scientific publications retrieved from 12 scientific databases in the period from 2004 to 2022 (corresponding to the solar Hijri years of 1383 to 1401), which is based on the Critical Appraisals Skills Programme (CASP) and screening process.

Therefore, 32 works were selected for further review and analysis. In this research, first, a separate code was considered for all the factors extracted from the selected publications, and then considering the concept of each of the codes, they were categorized in a similar concept. In this way, the concepts of the research were determined. Based on the analysis done with the help of content analysis method, there are a total of 7 main categories and 24 concepts, including digital culture (digital attitude, user-oriented, agility, participation and cooperation, creativity and innovation, learning digital skills of employees), digital librarian (individual competence, knowledge competence, communication competence, skill competence), digital manager (individual competence, knowledge competence, skill competence), digital services and resources (optimally reorganizing library resources, providing digital services to users, providing digital services to the organization mother), digital technologies (digital infrastructure, technological readiness, use digital technologies), support and cooperation of upstream institutions and the mother organization (to provide human resources, to provide technological resources and equipment, to make macro policies), and Work process and development of digital strategy (digitalization of processes and development of library digital strategy). 

The discussion of the digital transformation of organizations, including the digital transformation of university libraries, is complex, and managers and librarians cannot be expected to be familiar with these concepts without training or study and be able to move in the right direction toward the digital transformation of libraries. This research is the first research inside and outside of Iran that identified the components of the digital transformation of university libraries. The results of this research can be a good guide for an easy understanding of the effective factors and requirements of digital transformation of libraries and the importance of understanding it for managers and librarians Managerial and academic literature provide only limited guidance on how to drive the digital transformation of sales. This article presents a model for in-depth analysis of sales processes, goals for each process in terms of effectiveness and efficiency, and a structured set of digital responses. For managers, it provides actionable guidelines on how to drive the digital transformation of sales, a large set of inspiring examples, and an international benchmarking opportunity The aspirations to reduce environmental impact, the ongoing labor shortages, and the expanding possibilities of digital technologies urge logistics companies to reinvent their network designs, their methods of operating, and even their business models. For the logistics sector, we provide an overview of contextual perspectives, mechanisms of change, and outcomes in digitization, digitalization, and digital transformation. Specifically, we evaluate developments and opportunities in the logistics sector from the viewpoint of food distribution in cities. We find that both customers and suppliers in the food supply chain are willing to initiate or join novel logistics concepts that require collaboration with other stakeholders in the supply chain. Notably, we investigate attitudes towards the concept of bundling, where goods of different suppliers are jointly delivered to customers by the same vehicle. Furthermore, we quantitatively demonstrate the added value of such collaborative efforts. Collaborations between companies require an increased effort in digital exchange of data and other digital technologies to reap the potential benefits we determined. We identify an impending transformation in the business model of innovative food distributors that may change the landscape of food distribution in cities Purpose- The purpose of this study is to serve as an extensive outlook about digital transformation. Its content comprises the elements of digital transformation, the ways of adapting to digital transformation, reasons for failure, means of digital transformation, and insights and discussions on new business environment. Methodology- In this study, a comprehensive literature review is followed to learn about the current business circumstances regarding digital transformation and have a deep understanding on the previous studies conducted about digital transformation. Findings- The literature review reveals that digital transformation has provided positive impract on businesses at different levels. Although challenges against digital transformation may arise, they can be tackled if the nature of digital transformation is understood well. The success of digital transformation is dependent on numerous factors from different aspect which should be studied carefully before and during the adoption of digital transformation. Conclusion- It may be concluded that the COVID-19 pandemic has accelerated the digital agenda of businesses. At first, it should be understood that digital transformation is not a mere upgrade of technology or technical equipment within an organization but requires time, curiosity, creativity, recognition of opportunities, and cultural transformation. A successful adoption of digital transformation requires the recognition of means of digital transformation, the steps for adaptation to digital transformation, the analysis of failure, the outcomes of digital transformation. The recent evolutions related to digital transformation is evident in different aspects of business. The most recent observed changes in businesses are required skills of employees, organisational culture, business models, and customer relationship management practices.Publisher's Versio The aspirations to reduce environmental impact, the ongoing labor shortages, and the expanding possibilities of digital technologies urge logistics companies to reinvent their network designs, their methods of operating, and even their business models.

We identify an impending transformation in the business model of innovative food distributors that may change the landscape of food distribution in cities PT Penjaminan Infrastruktur Indonesia (Persero)/Indonesia Infrastructure Guarantee Fund (IIGF) is very aware of the important role of digital technology in collaborating both with internal and external stakeholders. The use of digital technology effectively will speed up the process of collaboration both within IIGF and expanded by digital collaboration with external stakeholders. In this final project will explore how to develop a digital transformation strategy at IIGF by studying literature on digital innovation theories, digital transformation, business model transformation, business process transformation and cultural/organizational transformation. The research method in this final project by identifying business issues, analyzing the status quo with interviews, analyzing factors related to digital transformation, formulating effective digital transformation strategies and providing recommendations for business solutions that can be pursued by the management of IIGF, implementation plan of digital transformation more effective. Based on the findings in this study, the results are that we provide business solutions within 3 main elements in digital transformation, namely people, processes and technology.
Keywords: Indonesia Infrastructure Guarantee Fund, PT PII (Persero), Government Guarantee, PPP, Digital Transformation Strateg Digital transformation is an important and omnipresent topic for corporations that want to stay relevant and survive in today’s business environment. The success of digital transformation depends on a multitude of factors, one of which is digital transformation governance. This study investigates the moderating effect of CIO membership in the top management team on the relationship between enabling factors of digital transformation and digital transformation success. Furthermore, different digital transformation governance configurations are investigated regarding their effect on the success of digital transformation. We make use of a large scale, multi-national survey among manufacturing firms to answer these two research questions. With our study, we demonstrate the importance of including the CIO in the top management team to take advantage of existing resources and capabilities. Additionally, we show that firms with a CIO being responsible for digital transformation perform significantly better in their digital transformation endeavors The digital transformation of manufacturing enterprises is in full swing. In practice, they often face the problems of resource constraints, lack of digital capability and changing environment, which leads to the dilemma of digital transformation. This paper uses the exploratory case study method to construct the strategic construct of digital transformation of manufacturing enterprises: The process of transforming enterprise strategy by applying digital technology under the leadership of senior management is an all-around transformation of enterprise organizational structure, operating process, business model and value creation mode. Case studies define the core concepts of this paper and discover the direct role of digital transformation strategy on digital innovation performance, the mediating role of resource patchwork and the mediating role of digital empowerment. Based on the results of case analysis and existing literature and theories, the research hypothesis is proposed and verified by empirical research. The results show that: (1) digital transformation strategy positively affects digital product and service innovation, performance and digital process innovation performance; (2) Environmental dynamics positively moderates the relationship between digital transformation strategy and digital process innovation performance, but has no significant positive moderating effect on the relationship between digital transformation strategy and digital product and service innovation performance. (3) Resource patchwork plays a partial mediating role between digital transformation strategy and innovation performance of digital products and services This book presents a collection of papers revealing the impact of advanced computation and instrumentation on healthcare. It highlights the increasing global trend driving innovation for a new era of multifunctional technologies for personalized digital healthcare. Moreover, it highlights that contemporary research on healthcare is performed on a multidisciplinary basis comprising computational engineering, biomedicine, biomedical engineering, electronic engineering, and automation engineering, among other areas A new issue is ready and the world is still trapped in the pandemic of COVID19. Many of us work from home, at least
partially. Traveling, especially in an international context, is restricted. Performing research and providing education is
challenging. Although we aim for physical distancing only, social distancing is one of the negative effects of the measures implemented to reduce the spread of the virus and its mutants. 
On the other hand, a crisis like the COVID-19 pandemic, also opens new chances. For example, the digital transformation of our societies gets a real push and might help us to develop a more sustainable behaviour. Videoconferences are now fully accepted, beneficial effects of remote teaching become visible, and thus in the future we will be better able to evaluate if travels are really needed.
The digital transformation also affects our glass research – and this will definitely continue: Digital image processing is
used in the paper of Dix et al. for the evaluation of anisotropy effects in pre-stressed glass; Drass et al. use semantic segmentation with deep learning for the detection of cracks at cut edges of flat glass, Hayez et al. give design rules for silicone joints in cold bent glass based on numerical simulations.
The other papers in the current issue focus on the glass itself and material combinations with glass. Pauli et al. perform experimental and numerical investigations on glass fragments to derive a material model which in the future
might be used to enhance post-fracture models for laminated glass, Brokmann et al. revisit the well-known problem of
subcritical crack growth as a function of the environmental conditions, Joachim et al. perform testing of a novel combination of materials in composite panels made of glass and fibre-reinforced plastics and finally Götzinger et al. show first results of a new type of glass laminates adding paper as an interlayer.
Stay healthy and keep reading our journal - especially if you are trapped at home Literature in digital transformation maturity is scarce. Digital transformation in higher education, especially after COVID-19 is seen as inevitable. This research explores digital transformation maturity and challenges within Higher Education. The significance of this study stems from the role digital transformation plays in today’s knowledge economy. This study proposes a new framework based on Deloitte’s 2019 digital transformation assessment framework with Petkovic 2014 mega and major higher education process mapping. The study triangulates the findings of multiple research instruments, including survey, interviews, case study, and direct observation. The research findings show a significant variance between the respondents’ perception of digital transformations maturity levels, and the core requirements of digital transformation maturity. The findings also show the lack of holistic vision, digital transformation competency, and data structure and processing as the leading challenges of digital transformation This study examines digital transformation-oriented priorities and practices in Turkish higher education. While digital technologies are gaining importance in every field with Industry 4.0, the business-human-technology relationship has entered the digital transformation process in a broader and systematic framework. Many digital technologies, such as blockchain, big data, artificial intelligence, and the Internet of Things, have occurred in almost all sectors. While the digital transformation process, accelerated by the fourth industrial revolution (Industry 4.0), increases the use and functionality of technology, digital technologies have become indispensable parts of individual and social life. While the digital transformation process increases the need for human resources with digital skills, digital technologies, which have gained importance with digitalization, have also led to the development of new professions. The digital transformation process has affected higher education as well as all sectors. Many digital-dimensional applications such as blockchain, metaverse, and digital twin, where digital technologies gain prominence in higher education, have begun to take their place. Turkish higher education also has a strategic role in the digital transformation process, training human resources, developing education and career relations, and university-industry cooperation. Implementing digital transformation-focused programs in Turkish higher education and training human resources sensitive to the digital economy has become more critical than ever in the digitalizing world. In this context, the first part of the study examines the concept of digital transformation and higher education. The second part reviews Turkish higher education's digital transformation goals and practices Incumbent businesses need to accelerate their digital transformation due to disruption from digital technologies, competition, behavioural changes, regulation, and pandemics. Nevertheless, many digital transformation investments have failed due to poor governance. Previous research has identified the hybrid of traditional and agile-adaptive IT governance mechanisms that influence digital transformation. However, it is important to measure the extent of mechanisms’ influence on organizational performance. Therefore, online survey data from 338 Indonesian banking and insurance respondents have been collected and analysed using the SEM-PLS. The results show that hybrid IT governance mechanisms have moderate influences on digital transformation, and digital transformation strongly influences organizational performance. The study contributes to research by analysing the effect of hybrid IT governance mechanisms on organizational performance, fully mediated by digital transformation. In practical terms, the measurement items from the hybrid IT governance mechanisms, digital transformation and organizational performance dimensions can be useful for guiding digital transformation journeys Cognitive Hyperconnected Digital Transformation provides an overview of the current Internet of Things (IoT) landscape, ranging from research, innovation and development priorities to enabling technologies in a global context. It is intended as a standalone book in a series that covers the Internet of Things activities of the IERC-Internet of Things European Research Cluster, including both research and technological innovation, validation and deployment. The book builds on the ideas put forward by the European Research Cluster, the IoT European Platform Initiative (IoT-EPI) and the IoT European Large-Scale Pilots Programme, presenting global views and state-of-the-art results regarding the challenges facing IoT research, innovation, development and deployment in the next years. Hyperconnected environments integrating industrial/business/consumer IoT technologies and applications require new IoT open systems architectures integrated with network architecture (a knowledge-centric network for IoT), IoT system design and open, horizontal and interoperable platforms managing things that are digital, automated and connected and that function in real-time with remote access and control based on Internet-enabled tools. The IoT is bridging the physical world with the virtual world by combining augmented reality (AR), virtual reality (VR), machine learning and artificial intelligence (AI) to support the physical-digital integrations in the Internet of mobile things based on sensors/actuators, communication, analytics technologies, cyber-physical systems, software, cognitive systems and IoT platforms with multiple functionalities. These IoT systems have the potential to understand, learn, predict, adapt and operate autonomously. They can change future behaviour, while the combination of extensive parallel processing power, advanced algorithms and data sets feed the cognitive algorithms that allow the IoT systems to develop new services and propose new solutions. IoT technologies are moving into the industrial space and enhancing traditional industrial platforms with solutions that break free of device-, operating system- and protocol-dependency. Secure edge computing solutions replace local networks, web services replace software, and devices with networked programmable logic controllers (NPLCs) based on Internet protocols replace devices that use proprietary protocols. Information captured by edge devices on the factory floor is secure and accessible from any location in real time, opening the communication gateway both vertically (connecting machines across the factory and enabling the instant availability of data to stakeholders within operational silos) and horizontally (with one framework for the entire supply chain, across departments, business units, global factory locations and other markets). End-to-end security and privacy solutions in IoT space require agile, context-aware and scalable components with mechanisms that are both fluid and adaptive. The convergence of IT (information technology) and OT (operational technology) makes security and privacy by default a new important element where security is addressed at the architecture level, across applications and domains, using multi-layered distributed security measures. Blockchain is transforming industry operating models by adding trust to untrusted environments, providing distributed security mechanisms and transparent access to the information in the chain. Digital technology platforms are evolving, with IoT platforms integrating complex information systems, customer experience, analytics and intelligence to enable new capabilities and business models for digital business Purpose- This study aims to examine how digitalization has affected and changed higher education. It focuses on the current situation of universities and their current processes and what they need to do to become digital. It aims to present a roadmap for universities to integrate and organize these important changes into their strategies by examining the digital transformation that affects the vision of universities. Methodology- The study employs a literature review using secondary data analysis. Findings- The analysis reveals that the role of universities in many aspects such as society and economy has changed and is expected to change disruptively over the next decade. Universities need to make a differentiation through emerging business models in such a competitive higher education sector. Higher education institutions have to adapt to technological changes for sustainabilty. The pandemic dramatically accelerated the pace of technological adoption worldwide. The drivers of digital transformation in universiteis can be summarized as the increase compteteiveness, user experience and agility while reduction in operating expenses. Conclusion- It may be concluded that a university should be part of present technological trends and include digitalization in their strategies to be competitive in the future. Universities need to focus mainly on exploring more innovative measures to create technology development centres through research to deal with skills shortages. Universities should support those academics who lead the improvement of digital skills and innovative teaching methods, promote digital literacy in the academia and encourage the use of learning platforms. It is important to set a clear policy to adopt digital age in higher education. Universities will be competing globally for students, academic staff and funding. Adoption and implementation of new technologies in universities are inevitable.Publisher's Versio Although digital transformation offers a number of opportunities for today’s organizations, information systems scholars and practitioners struggle to grasp what digital transformation really is, particularly in terms of how it differs from the well-established concept of information technology (IT)-enabled organizational transformation. By integrating literature from organization science and information systems research with two longitudinal case studies—one on digital transformation, the other on IT-enabled organizational transformation—we develop an empirically grounded conceptualization that sets these two phenomena apart. We find that there are two distinctive differences: (1) digital transformation activities leverage digital technology in (re)defining an organization’s value proposition, while IT-enabled organizational transformation activities leverage digital technology in supporting the value proposition, and (2) digital transformation involves the emergence of a new organizational identity, whereas IT-enabled organizational transformation involves the enhancement of an existing organizational identity. We synthesize these arguments in a process model to distinguish the different types of transformations and propose directions for future research Around 70% of companies fail to successfully implement a digital transformation (DT) (Forth, et al. 2020, 1). This study examines the critical success factors (SFs) of a DT. Existing academic views on the SFs of a DT are reviewed and then compared with the results of primary research. Six key clusters of a DT are identified, each containing several SFs. Furthermore, action steps are examined to provide practical guidance to companies. It was found that the experts’ perceptions and experiences are broadly consistent with the derived academic perspectives. However, some SFs seem to be more important than others Digital innovation facilitates digital transformation of companies. Companies which conduct digital innovation can have and sustain competitive advantages in the market place. Digital product innovation, digital process innovation and digital business model innovation are major types of digital innovation. The purpose of this paper is to highlight the concept of digital innovation, explain its types and focus on its advantages for companies. Digital innovation is using information and communication technology (ICT) to create new and improved products, processes, business models, marketing and organizational methods and network. It has three main types namely digital product innovation, digital process innovation and digital business model innovation. Its advantages can be summarized as reducing costs, improving productivity and relationships with stakeholders, and increasing competitive advantages, market share, sales and profits Digital transformation is an inevitability in the era of society 5.0. This study examined the digital transformation of Islamic education of Pesantren in Madura. This study employed qualitative approach, focusing on social education. The study was conducted using interview techniques for Kiai, santri,&nbsp; and researchers in Madura. There were three social facts in the digital transformation of Islamic education. First, the digital transformation in Kiai Pesantren Madura Perspective. Second, implementation of digital transformation of Islamic education at Pesantren Madura. Third, opportunities and challenges for pesantren in facing digital transformation in Islamic education. The Kiai in Pesantren Madura who initially practiced traditional Islamic education were following the development of digital transformation. The positive response can be seen from their perspective on the digital transformation of Islamic education and its implementation in facing digital transformation. Also, some Pesantren have prepared digital literacy facilities and human resources. Even though they have great opportunities in implementing digital transformation, they have the challenge of limited human resources and facilities.Transformasi digital merupakan keniscayaan di era masyarakat 5.0. Tulisan ini mengkaji transformasi digital pendidikan Islam yang terjadi pesantren Madura. Tulisan ini menggunakan metode kualitatif dengan pendedekan pendidikan social. Dengan teknik wawancara terhadap Kiai, santri dan peneliti pesantren di Madura. Terdapat tiga fakta social dalam transformasi digital pendidikan Islam.

In 2013, about 2.2 million (or 10 percent) of the nation’s nearly 22 million veterans were women. This number is projected to increase to 2.4 million by 2020. In contrast, the number of male veterans is projected to decrease from 20.1 million to 17.2 million by 2020 Produced by the WNY Women\u27s Foundation in August 2017, this fact sheet details information and statistics about women and children experiencing poverty in WNY Department of Labor - Women's Bureaunontra1999.pdf: 190 downloads, before Oct. 1, 2020 https://digitalscholarship.unlv.edu/wrin_news/1001/thumbnail.jp https://digitalscholarship.unlv.edu/wrin_news/1002/thumbnail.jp [Excerpt] Census Bureau data from 2013 show that 12.6 percent of the U.S. population has some form of disability, although estimates of the proportion of the population living with a disability may vary depending on the definition of the term disabled. In 2014, working-age (16-64 years old) women with disabilities made up 1.5 percent of the workforce even though they were nearly 4 percent of the U.S. working age population. These women represent a critical source of untapped labor force talent. In 2014, seven in ten working-age individuals with disabilities were not in the labor force, compared with about two in ten working-age individuals with no disability. In addition to facing persistently low employment, women with disabilities often face difficulties accessing adequate housing, health and education; unequal hiring and promotion standards; and unequal pay https://digitalscholarship.unlv.edu/wrin_news/1020/thumbnail.jp	['38755572', '63664202', '2352509', '45174120', '68974338', '10677222', '38755548', '10721982']	[[{'name': 'Women\\u27s Bureau'}], [{'name': 'WNY Women\\u27s Foundation'}], [{'name': 'Women\\u27s Bureau, U.S.'}], [{'name': 'Women\\u27s Research Institute of Nevada'}], [{'name': 'University of Arkansas, Fayetteville.

We aimed to estimate the prevalence of asthma among secondary school pupils in urban and rural areas of coast districts of Tanzania. The study also aimed to describe pupils' perception towards asthma, and to assess their knowledge on symptoms, triggers, and treatment of asthma. A total of 610 pupils from Ilala district and 619 pupils from Bagamoyo district formed the urban and rural groups, respectively. Using a modified International Study of Asthma and Allergies in Childhood (ISAAC) questionnaire, a history of ""diagnosed"" asthma or the presence of a wheeze in the previous 12 months was obtained from all the studied pupils, along with documentation of their perceptions regarding asthma. Pupils without asthma or wheeze in the prior 12 months were subsequently selected and underwent a free running exercise testing. A >= 20% decrease in the post-exercise Peak Expiratory Flow Rate (PEFR) values was the criterion for diagnosing exercise-induced asthma. The mean age of participants was 16.8 (+/-1.8) years. The prevalence of wheeze in the past 12 months was 12.1% in Bagamoyo district and 23.1% in Ilala district (p < 0.001). Self-reported asthma was found in 17.6% and 6.4% of pupils in Ilala and Bagamoyo districts, respectively (p < 0.001). The prevalence of exercise-induced asthma was 2.4% in Bagamoyo, and 26.3% in Ilala (P < 0.002). In both districts, most information on asthma came from parents, and there was variation in symptoms and triggers of asthma reported by the pupils. Non-asthmatic pupils feared sleeping, playing, and eating with their asthmatic peers. The prevalence rates of self-reported asthma, wheezing in the past 12 months, and exercise-induced asthma were significantly higher among urban than rural pupils. Although bronchial asthma is a common disease, pupils' perceptions about asthma were associated with fear of contact with their asthmatic peers in both rural and urban schools Background

People with asthma who come from minority groups have poorer asthma outcomes and more asthma related visits to Emergency Departments (ED). Various programmes are used to educate and empower people with asthma and these have previously been shown to improve certain asthma outcomes. Models of care for chronic diseases in minority groups usually include a focus of the cultural context of the individual and not just the symptoms of the disease. Therefore, questions about whether culturally specific asthma education programmes for people from minority groups are effective at improving asthma outcomes, are feasible and are cost-effective need to be answered.

Objectives

To determine whether culture-specific asthma programmes, in comparison to generic asthma education programmes or usual care, improve asthma related outcomes in children and adults with asthma who belong to minority groups.

Search strategy

We searched the Cochrane Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), the Cochrane Airways Group Specialised Register, MEDLINE, EMBASE, review articles and reference lists of relevant articles. The latest search was performed in May 2008.

Selection criteria

All randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing the use of culture-specific asthma education programmes with generic asthma education programmes, or usual care, in adults or children from minority groups who suffer from asthma.

Data collection and analysis

Two review authors independently selected, extracted and assessed the data for inclusion. We contacted authors for further information if required.

Main results

Four studies were eligible for inclusion in the review. A total of 617 patients, aged from 5 to 59 years were included in the meta-analysis of data. Use of a culture-specific programme was superior to generic programmes or usual care, in improving asthma quality of life scores in adults, pooled WMD 0.25 (95% CI 0.09 to 0.41), asthma knowledge scores in children, WMD 3.30 (95% CI 1.07 to 5.53), and in a single study, reducing asthma exacerbation in children (risk ratio for hospitalisations 0.32, 95% CI 0.15, 0.70).

Authors' conclusions

Current limited data show that culture-specific programmes for adults and children from minority groups with asthma, are more effective than generic programmes in improving most (quality of life, asthma knowledge, asthma exacerbations, asthma control) but not all asthma outcomes. This evidence is limited by the small number of included studies and the lack of reported outcomes. Further trials are required to answer this question conclusively Chicago is known for many things, our great food and architecture. Unfortunately, we are also known for being an epi-center for asthma. We lead the Nation in asthma deaths, emergency room visits and hospitalizations. More than half (58%) of all children with asthma in Chicago had a severe asthma attack in the past year and nearly one-third (31%) had an asthma attack so bad they thought their life was in danger. Additionally, Latinos suffer from disproportionately high rates of asthma. Asthma is a life long chronic illness that effects the airways and lungs. With proper education and management asthma can be controlled and people with asthma should be able to live life the same as others Chicago is known for many things, our great food and architecture.

METHODS: We use the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth (n = 7,644) and linear and logistic regressions to estimate the association between wealth and asthma. Changes in relative wealth following an asthma diagnosis and asthma status by increases in wealth through inheritance provide evidence on the causal direction. RESULTS: Asthma, particularly severe asthma, is associated with lower wealth. Wealth ranking does not change after a diagnosis of asthma, but inheriting a substantial sum is associated with a lower risk of severe asthma. CONCLUSION: Wealth appears to protect against severe asthma, supporting the social causation model of disease.Accepted manuscrip"	['35028', '4521599', '36986942', '36986837', '83528175']	[[{'name': 'A Rodriguez'}, {'name': 'A Senthilselvan'}, {'name': 'B Quarm-Goka'}, {'name': 'C Niekerk'}, {'name': 'D Keeley'}, {'name': 'E von Mutius'}, {'name': 'EA Yobo'}, {'name': 'EF Crain'}, {'name': 'EG Weinberg'}, {'name': 'F Mugusi'}, {'name': 'Ferdinand Mugusi'}, {'name': 'Godfrey Mutashambara Rwegerera'}, {'name': 'GW Wong'}, {'name': 'H Anderson'}, {'name': 'H Anderson'}, {'name': 'J Liebhart'}, {'name': 'J Odhiambo'}, {'name': 'Julius Chacha Mwita'}, {'name': 'KM Hurwitz'}, {'name': 'M Asher'}, {'name': 'Meshack Shimwela'}, {'name': 'MI Asher'}, {'name': 'Michael Mwandri'}, {'name': 'N Ait‒Khaled'}, {'name': 'N Pearce'}, {'name': 'R Beasley'}, {'name': 'S Berntsen'}, {'name': 'SBL Barnett'}, {'name': 'The United Republic of Tanzania'}, {'name': 'Yohana Mashalla'}], [{'name': 'Bailey, EJ'}, {'name': 'Brown, N'}, {'name': 'Cates, CJ'}, {'name': 'Chang, AB'}, {'name': 'Kruske, SG'}, {'name': 'Morris, PS'}], [], [], [{'name': 'Smith, Patricia K.'}, {'name': 'Zagorsky, Jay L.'}]]	['Asthma Prevalence, Knowledge, and Perceptions among Secondary School Pupils in Rural and Urban Costal Districts in Tanzania.', 'Culture-specific programs for children and adults from minority groups who have asthma (Review)', 'Estadsticas del Asma en Los Latinos', 'Chicago Asthma Epidemic: The Status of Asthma in Chicago', 'Does asthma impair wealth accumulation or does wealth protect against asthma?']	5.0	exploratory	0.5

Wagner PMC’s prominent, if not officially acknowledged, role in the offensive on Ukraine has accelerated a process by which it has semi-privatised certain functions of state security. This is likely to have an impact on the nature of the Russian state in the years ahead The text discusses significant recent developments in Russia's political landscape, notably the Prigozhin insurgency, which challenged the ""perception of stability"" under President Putin. The author highlights the potential scenarios for the country's future. When examining the attempted coup in Russia, it's crucial to highlight Vladimir Putin's vulnerability, evident in his decision to permit Yevgeny Prigozhin and fellow Wagner PMC leaders to depart unhindered to Belarus.
There are enough hypotheses as to why the Wagner PMC, which always protected the interests of the Putin government, revolted against the government. The insurrection was so massive that mercenaries quickly captured Rostov-on-Don during the rebellion, entering the city, including in tanks. During the day, the rebels, with minimal resistance, passed the Voronezh, Lipetsk, and Tula regions, heading to Moscow. The swift conclusion of the rebellion within a day raises numerous uncertainties. The circumstances surrounding it remain puzzling: Prigozhin vanished from the scene, only for Belarusian leader Alexander Lukashenko to emerge.
The Ukrainian invasion has serious implications for the Putin government, potentially prompting changes in leadership. The failed coup attempt involving Prigozhin and his departure to Belarus raises questions about Putin's authority and possible arrangements.
The text concludes by discussing the impact of a coup on Russia's stability and the potential for multiple coups leading to a tumultuous transition with global implications.

It emphasizes the interest in avoiding bloodshed and maintaining stability from both Russian and Western perspectives The Wagner Group has emerged as one of the most prominent actors of the on-going Russo-Ukrainian war. Although Private Military Companies are banned by the Russian Constitution and Russian Criminal Code, Wagner has been able and permitted to operate all across the world as a foreign policy tool of the Russian state. However, Wagner’s use and employment in Ukraine has differed drastically compared to Syria, Central African Republic and Libya, as the group is employed in a more conventional capacity. With many of the Russian successes in the east of Ukraine attributable to Wagner, the financier of the group, Yevgeny Prigozhin, has started to use these successes to criticize the way the war is conducted, creating tensions in the Russian political sphere.
This paper examines the role that the Wagner Group has played in the Russo-Ukrainian war. Moreover, the paper focuses on how the Wagner Group evolved from a small contingent used for advancing foreign policy goals to a considerably large parallel military structure alongside the Russian Army with a great degree of autonomy and political leverage, ultimately projecting power and posing a potential threat to Russian political and military elites This short article provides an overview of developments around the Wagner mutiny, focusing on its role in Russia’s political regime and the state's efforts to regain control in the aftermath of the mutiny It is too early to predict exactly what will happen to the Wagner Group forces that are currently deployed abroad. This article considers several Russian paramilitary groups that might be alternative hosts for former Wagnerites - including Redut and Konvoy, among others - and their associated commercial and forcebased activities The first time Russia invaded Ukraine in the twenty-first century, the Wagner Group was born. The now widely profiled private military company (PMC) played an important role in exercising Russian national power over the Crimea and portions of the Donbas—while giving Moscow a semblance of plausible deniability. In the near decade since, the Russian PMC sector has grown considerably, and is active in more than a dozen countries around the world. PMCs are paramilitary organizations established and run as private companies—though they often operate in contract with one or more states. They are profit-motivated, expeditionary groups that make a business of the conduct of war. PMCs are in no way a uniquely Russian phenomenon, yet the expanding footprint of Russian PMCs and their links to state interests call for a particularly Russian-focused analysis of the industry. The growth of these firms and their direct links to the Kremlin's oligarch network as well as Moscow's foreign media, industrial, and cyber activities present a challenge to the United States and its allies as they seek to counter Russian malicious activities abroad.The accelerating frequency of PMCs found operating around the world and the proliferation of private hacking, surveillance, and social media manipulation tools suggest that Russian PMCs will pose diverse policy challenges to the United States and allies going forward. This issue brief seeks to offer an initial exploration of these questions in the context of how these PMCs came about and how they are employed today. The section below addresses the origin and operations of PMCs in Russian international security strategy, and also profiles the changing role of technology in conflict and the activities of these PMCs.

Research and development efforts for the practical application of solar energy -- including wind energy -- as alternative energy supplies are assessed in: (1) Heating and cooling of buildings; (2) photovoltaic energy conversion; (3) solar thermal energy conversion; (4) wind energy conversion; (5) ocean thermal energy conversion; (6) photosynthetic production of organic matter; and (7) conversion of organic matter into fuels Ocean engineers and scientists are transforming the way we experience and understand the ocean through Integrated Ocean Observing Systems (IOOS). For the first time, there will be continuous, sustained, near-realtime, multi-dimensional data available from the oceans, collected both from within the oceans using sensors systems and above using remote sensing methodologies. These data make possible inquiry-driven questions concerning the dynamic nature of the ocean's physical, biological and chemical characteristics in both time and space. These data provide unique and meaningful access to the ocean for a broad range of users. One major expected user group is K-12 educators and their students, who will be able to explore and utilize data and information from coastal observing systems in real time from the classroom. This workshop, held in July of 2005, explored the feasability of developing a collection of resources, tools, and/or classroom applications that use National Ocean Observing Systems (NOOS) data and resources to promote ocean literacy and supplement classroom learning and understanding of the ocean environment. Educational levels: Graduate or professional The figure of the University Ombudsperson was created in Spain by means of the 14th
section of the University Law, as a guarantor, who must “take care for the respect of the rights and freedom of teachers, students and staff, to act before the actions of different parts and/or university services”.
In, some cases, his/her competence on members of the university goes farther, as the
Ombudsperson also guards people who arrive or approach the University in a direct or
indirect way (e.g. students who have denied their access to University) or other people enrolled in it by means of successive subcontracting (e.g. staff from coffee shops or copy shops, cleaning or computer services, security service, etc.) Slides from a presentation which provides and overview of building simulation in Europe This paper describes two experiments carried out in order to investigate the role of visuals in multimodal answer presentations for a medical question answering system. First, a production experiment was carried out to determine which modalities people choose to answer different types of questions. In this experiment, participants had to create (multimodal) presentations of answers to general medical questions. The collected answer presentations were coded on the presence of visual media (i.e., photos, graphics, and animations) and their function. The results indicated that participants presented the information in a multimodal way. Moreover, significant differences were found in the presentation of different answer and question types. Next, an evaluation experiment was conducted to investigate how users evaluate different types of multimodal answer presentations. In this second experiment, participants had\ud
to assess the informativity and attractiveness of answer presentations for different types of medical questions. These answer presentations, originating from the production experiment, were manipulated in their answer length (brief vs. extended) and their type of picture (illustrative vs. informative). After the participants had assessed the answer presentations, they received a post-\ud
test in which they had to indicate how much they had recalled from the presented answer presentations. The results showed that answer presentations with an informative picture were evaluated as more informative and more attractive than answer presentations with an illustrative picture. The results for the post-test tentatively indicated that learning from answer presentations with an informative picture leads to a better learning performance than learning from purely textual answer presentations Decision support systems can either directly support a product designer or support an agent operating within a multi-agent system (MAS).  Stochastic based decision support systems require an underlying belief model that encodes domain knowledge.  The underlying supporting belief model has traditionally been a probability distribution function (PDF) which uses pointwise probabilities for all possible outcomes.  This can present a challenge during the knowledge elicitation process.  To overcome this, it is proposed to test the performance of a credal set belief model.  Credal sets (sometimes also referred to as p-boxes) use interval probabilities rather than pointwise probabilities and therefore are more easier to elicit from domain experts.  The PDF and credal set belief models are compared using a design domain MAS which is able to learn, and thereby refine, the belief model based on its experience.  The outcome of the experiment illustrates that there is no significant difference between the PDF based and credal set based belief models in the performance of the MAS Conservation and repair of historic rammed earth sites should only be undertaken if there is a good understanding of the consequences of any intervention technique. Until recently there has been little interest in the characterisation of historic rammed earth construction, yet it is only with this understanding that successful conservation strategies can be adopted.

A survey of around 60 historic rammed earth sites in Spain constructed between 967AD and 1837AD has recently been undertaken. While all the sites are built primarily in rammed earth, the construction techniques and state of repair vary greatly. The high density of historic rammed earth structures in the Iberian peninsula is likely due to the Muslim presence there from the 8th century onwards. Initial expansion, a period of civil war and eventual defeat by Christians led to the construction of a large number of fortifications, many constructed in rammed earth. A famous example is the Alhambra at Granada, but there are hundreds of smaller sites throughout Spain. By the end of the 15th century Christians had replaced Muslims through most of Spain, but rammed earth continued to be used in both vernacular and monumental architecture.

Examples of historic construction techniques are presented and common features of historic rammed earth construction are identified. A classification is outlined and a clear development of the rammed earth technique is observed The Mekong Delta in Southern Vietnam is one of the most at risk places globally to the effects of climate change and sea level rise, specifically in terms of flooding. It is predicted to change drastically over the next 100 years, with additional human-driven actions (such as sand mining and groundwater extraction) expected to exasperate the speed and severity of said change. Understanding the existing perceptions of those that will face these future challenges, and what contributes to forming those perceptions, is a critical underpinning required for the success of any future resilience and mitigation initiatives. A holistic view that takes account of these varying influences on societal perceptions, resilience and education needs to be taken. One of the most vulnerable groups to the consequences of climate change, and indeed the citizens that will go on to tackle the majority of challenges we are predicted to face in the future, is children. For this reason alone, ascertaining their perceptions and understandings, along with the influences and sources that shape their views, is paramount.This paper will present the findings from a project that explored local children’s perceptions of climate change in the heart of the Mekong Delta. Creative and arts-based methods enabled children’s voices to be heard. Combined with further policy analysis and interviews with parents, teachers and government officials, these voices have been further contextualised within their socio-cultural context and environment. Through developing an understanding of these perceptions and the influencing factors, a more effective and holistic approach to shaping children’s climate change resilience can be executed, which will ultimately enhance a society’s ability to adapt to and mitigate the impacts of climate change into the future A sampling of the myriad activities of the law school community - highlighting a diverse range of leadership in scholarship, teaching, and public service We consider partitioned graphs, by which we mean finite strongly connected
directed graphs with a partitioned edge set $ {\mathcal E} ={\mathcal E}^-
\cup{\mathcal E}^+$. With additionally given a relation $\mathcal R$ between
the edges in ${\mathcal E}^-$ and the edges in $\mathcal E^+ $, and denoting
the vertex set of the graph by ${\frak P}$, we speak of an an ${\mathcal
R}$-graph ${\mathcal G}_{\mathcal R}({\frak P},{\mathcal E}^-,{\mathcal E}^+)
$. From ${\mathcal R}$-graphs ${\mathcal G}_{\mathcal R}({\frak P},{\mathcal
E}^-,{\mathcal E}^+) $ we construct semigroups (with zero) ${\mathcal
S}_{\mathcal R}({\frak P}, {\mathcal E}^-,{\mathcal E}^+) $ that we call
${\mathcal R}$-graph semigroups. We describe a method of presenting subshifts
by means of suitably structured labelled directed graphs $({\mathcal V},
\Sigma,\lambda)$ with vertex set ${\mathcal V}$, edge set $\Sigma$, and a label
map that asigns to the edges in $\Sigma$ labels in an ${\mathcal R}$-graph
semigroup ${\mathcal S}_{\mathcal R}({\frak P}, {\mathcal E}^-, {\mathcal
E}^-)$. We call the presented subshift an ${\mathcal S}_{\mathcal R}({\frak P},
{\mathcal E}^-, {\mathcal E}^-)$-presentation.
  We introduce a Property $(B)$ and a Property (c), tof subshifts, and we
introduce a notion of strong instantaneity. Under an assumption on the
structure of the ${\mathcal R}$-graphs ${\mathcal G}_{\mathcal R}({\frak
P},{\mathcal E}^-, {\mathcal E}^-)$ we show for strongly instantaneous
subshifts with Property $(A)$ and associated semigroup ${\mathcal S}_{\mathcal
R}({\frak P},{\mathcal E}^-,{\mathcal E}^-)$, that Properties $(B)$ and (c) are
necessary and sufficient for the existence of an ${\mathcal S}_{\mathcal
R}({\frak P}, {\mathcal E}^-,{\mathcal E}^-)$-presentation, to which the
subshift is topologically conjugate,Comment: 33 page At the beginning of the interview, the interviewee

The titania-supported catalyst did not only show higher stability than alumina, but also presented a different cause of deactivation, carbon formation. In addition, a kinetic model was obtained for the titania-supported catalyst, and a study of the effect of different operating conditions (temperature, composition and partial pressures of synthesis gas and water) on the deactivation rate and carbon formation of this catalyst was performed. </p The changes in information technology nowadays has influenced in many aspects, include the accounting system. In manual accounting, employees need to perform the whole accounting cycle manually on a periodic basis, while in computerized accounting; employees can use computer and accounting software to perform the job. By using AIS the tasks can perform easily and any kinds of report can be made easily. The changing in accounting system can impact the audit process. Audit need to adjust the system, both in audit process and personnel who conduct the audit. The personnel should have a good understanding of clients’ business process and knowledge about information technology, therefore audit will result in a good internal control. Internal control can detect whether organization’s objective can be achieved effectively and efficiently. The implementation of internal control on AIS audit meets some constraint namely need of continuous monitoring of internal control especially for network breakdown, hacked system, virus threatened, and difficulty tracing the audit trails The goal of this study was the investigation of
the effectiveness of dialkyldithiophosphate acids (HDDPs)
films in improving the tribological properties of thin, sol–
gel derived titania coatings. Amorphous, anatase, and rutile
titania coatings were obtained using sol–gel dip–coating
deposition after treatment at 100, 500, and 1,000 C,
respectively. Titania coatings were then modified from the
liquid phase by HDDPs acids having dodecyl-(C12), tetradecyl-(C14),
and hexadecyl-(C16) alkyl chains deposited by
dip–coating (DC) and Langmuir–Blodgett (LB) methods.
The influence of the deposition procedure, the length of the
HDDPs alkyl chain and the type of titania substrate on the
surface morphology and tribological properties were studied.
It was found, using wetting contact angle measurements,
that these modifications of titania coatings decrease
the surface free energy and increase its hydrophobicity.
The surface topography imaged by Atomic force microscopy
(AFM), exhibit island-like or agglomerate features for
the DC deposition method, while smooth topographies
were observed for LB depositions. Tribological tests were
conducted by means of a microtribometer operating in the
normal load range 30–100 mN. An enhancement of tribological
properties was observed upon modification, as
compared to unmodified titania Two approaches were postulated for improving the stability of porous texture of titania membranes: (1) retarding the phase transformation and grain growth; (2) avoiding the phase transformation. Based on the second approach, rutile membranes were made directly from a rutile sol, prepared by the precipitation of titania on SnO2 nuclei. The rutile membranes were stable up to 800 °C, with a porosity of ca. 40%, whereas normal titania membranes (starting with anatase) show very little porosity above 600 °C. Alumina substitution retards grain growth and pore growth at 850 °C for unsupported as well as supported membranes. \u Management of regional budget and expenditure of Kulon Progo is the authority of regional governments and must be adapted to the conditions of regional communities. Financial management of a region has been taught in Islamic law since the time of the Prophet. The concept of regional financial management based on Islamic law must apply the principles of justice. The Kulon Progo Regency government is known to be the district with the smallest financial income/revenue among other districts in Yogyakarta. With small financial revenues, the government still has to distribute regional finances fairly. Therefore, this research aims to analyze the management of regional income and expenditure budgets in Kulon Progo Regency from an Islamic Public Finance Perspective for the 2022-2023 Period. The research method used descriptive qualitative analysis.

The titaniashell can serve as a selective nucleation site for the growth of nanocrystalline anatase clusters. These fully inorganic pure silica-core titania-enriched shell mesoporous nanoparticles show orthogonal functionality, demonstrated through the selective adsorption of a carboxylate-containing ruthenium N3-dye. UV-Vis and fluorescence spectroscopy indicate the strong interaction of the N3-dye with the titania-phase at the outer shell of the CMS nanoparticles.

However, due to the inaccurate parameter estimation of aged battery cells and multi-cell batteries, current BMSs cannot control batteries optimally, and therefore affect the usability of products. In this paper, we proposed a smart management system for multi-cell batteries, and discussed the development of our research study in three directions: i) improving the effectiveness of battery monitoring and current sensing, ii) modeling the battery aging process, and iii) designing a self-healing circuit system to compensate performance variations due to aging and other variations.published_or_final_versio V této prací jsou shrnuty elektrické vlastnosti baterií LiFePo4 v závislostech na teplotě, stavu nabití, stáří baterie, jsou zmíněny i dynamické vlastnosti a možnosti modelování.

known as battery life. The underlying solution to equalize the balance of cell voltage and SOC between the cells when they are in complete charge. In order to control and extend the battery life, the battery cell balancing is design and manipulated in such way as well as shorten the

charging process. Active and passive cell balancing strategies as a unique hallmark enables the

balancing of the battery with the excellent performances configuration so that the charging process will be faster. The experimental and simulation covers an analysis of how fast the battery can balance for certain time. The simulation based analysis is conducted to certify the

use of optimisation in active or passive cell balancing to extend battery life for long periods of

time Problem Statement:
There have been recent reports of multi-million dollar companies having to recall entire projects due to their BMS’s malfunctioning or operating incorrectly. The purpose of this project is to analyze the future of batteries, the Lithium-Ion cell, and to exercise a BMS to better understand its capabilities and possible cases for errors. Lithium ion batteries are intolerant of overcharge and overdischarge. Abuse of this kind can result in high temperatures, venting of gases, fire, or explosion. Therefore battery management systems have been devised to prevent such abuse. Recent events such as fires on the Boeing Dreamliner and the Tesla Model S have shown that these dangers are real. These products do have highly developed battery management systems, and the incidents were caused in spite of these systems. This study was undertaken to illustrate how one system from Texas Instruments, functions to monitor and control a simple battery pack.
Part I: Battery Data Acquisition
Preliminary battery tests were conducted to fully understand the operations of charging and discharging the battery. These tests were essential to gain a better understanding of typical battery behavior and to be able to perform calculations necessary in analyzing the characteristics of the batteries. Also, these tests were ran to ensure that the Lithium-Ion batteries being used correctly corresponded to the graphs and values provided by the datasheet. The knowledge gained from Part I was vital for a better comprehension of the functions needed to balance the cells for Part II as well as the importance of safety precautions necessary when dealing with multiple batteries. 
Part II: Exercising the BQ76PL536 & GUI
The BQ76PL536 Evaluation Module (EVM) was tested using the BQ7PL536 BMS chips. An Aardvark adapter acts as a link between the EVM and PC allowing the user to read data from the BMS chips on a GUI. The BMS chips are validated by reading voltages of individual battery cells, pack voltage, and pack temperature. The GUI allows for enabling cell balancing between the cells but this feature is not automatic and must be engaged by the user.
Part III: BMS Application
A MSP430fr5969 microcontroller was implemented to create a BMS system that can read data from the BMS chips such as cell voltage, pack voltage, pack temperature, fault statuses, alert statuses, and a variety of other useful cell parameters. This data is displayed on a LCD screen through different menu options. The user scrolls through the menus using a capacitive touch slider on the microcontroller and selections a given option using the option select button. There is also a cell balance mode that will check the cells to see if they are out of balance and then enable cell balancing if the cells are unbalanced. This section is designed to remove the Aardvark adaptor and the GUI from the system Lithium batteries provide excellent energy storage capabilities at a relatively high density; however, precautions must be taken with these high energy devices to ensure safe operation. A battery management system (BMS) provides protection by monitoring cell and pack voltage levels and maintaining them in a specific range. They limit the output current and disable the output in extreme conditions. Most devices in the targeted power range (\u3c1000W) do not allow the user to manipulate the values for maximum current, cut-off voltage, or other limits. This project introduces the Programmable BMS (PBMS), which instead allows the user to select these values through a physical interface. The interface displays measurements including pack voltage and output current, and it reports additional characteristics of interest such as the battery’s temperature, state of charge, and cumulative number of charge cycles. This level of access and control permits users to receive the maximum performance and safety from common lithium battery packs Autonomous drones (also known as unmanned aerial vehicles) are increasingly
popular for diverse applications of light-weight delivery and as substitutions
of manned operations in remote locations. The computing systems for drones are
becoming a new venue for research in cyber-physical systems. Autonomous drones
require integrated intelligent decision systems to control and manage their
flight missions in the absence of human operators. One of the most crucial
aspects of drone mission control and management is related to the optimization
of battery lifetime. Typical drones are powered by on-board batteries, with
limited capacity. But drones are expected to carry out long missions. Thus, a
fully automated management system that can optimize the operations of
battery-operated autonomous drones to extend their operation time is highly
desirable. This paper presents several contributions to automated management
systems for battery-operated drones: (1) We conduct empirical studies to model
the battery performance of drones, considering various flight scenarios. (2) We
study a joint problem of flight mission planning and recharging optimization
for drones with an objective to complete a tour mission for a set of sites of
interest in the shortest time. This problem captures diverse applications of
delivery and remote operations by drones. (3) We present algorithms for solving
the problem of flight mission planning and recharging optimization. We
implemented our algorithms in a drone management system, which supports
real-time flight path tracking and re-computation in dynamic environments. We
evaluated the results of our algorithms using data from empirical studies. (4)
To allow fully autonomous recharging of drones, we also develop a robotic
charging system prototype that can recharge drones autonomously by our drone
management system Here this document provides the data about the batteries of electric vehicles. It consists of numerous data about various energy storage methods in EVs and how it is different from energy storage of IC-engine vehicles. How electric vehicles will take over ICEngine vehicles due to advancement in battery technology and the shrink in its prices. Various types of batteries are listed in the document with their specifications. Possible future battery technology which will have more or same energy density than current gasoline fuels and also with the significant reduction in battery weights; which will make EVs cheaper than current condition. Some examples are listed showing current battery capacities of various EVs models. Some battery parameters are shown in the document with introduction to BMS (Battery Management System). Then a brief introduction about the charging of these EV batteries and its types displaying variations in charging time in different types of EVs according to their charger type and manufacturers. How DC charging is more time saving method than AC and how smart charging will help to grid in case of peak or grid failure conditions Battery modeling is one of the most important functions in a battery management system for different applications such as electrical vehicles, This article focuses on state of the art of lithium-ion battery modeling by exploring different existing modeling methods, such as Electrochemical models, Analytical models and the equivalent electrical circuit. First, the characteristics of the lithium-ion battery for different applications are reviewed ,we chose to study this type of battery because it offers satisfactory characteristics compared to other battery types, then the different modeling methods have been explored, finaly a conclusion with suggestion of other modeling type such as fractional order model have been proposed to improve efficiency and precision of battery management system Batteries are widely applied to the energy storage and power supply in portable electronics, transportation, power systems, communication networks, etc. They are particularly demanded in the emerging technologies of vehicle electrification and renewable energy integration for a green and sustainable society. To meet various voltage, power, and energy requirements in large-scale applications, multiple battery cells have to be connected in series and/or parallel. While battery technology has advanced significantly in the past decade, existing battery management systems (BMSs) mainly focus on state monitoring and control of battery systems packed in fixed configurations. In fixed configurations, though, the battery system performance is in principle limited by the weakest cells, which can leave large parts severely underutilized. Allowing dynamic reconfiguration of battery cells, on the other hand, allows individual and flexible manipulation of the battery system at cell, module, and pack levels, which may open up a new paradigm for battery management. Following this trend, this paper provides an overview of next-generation BMSs featuring dynamic reconfiguration. Motivated by numerous potential benefits of reconfigurable battery systems (RBSs), the hardware designs, management principles, and optimization algorithms for RBSs are sequentially and systematically discussed. Theoretical and practical challenges during the design and implementation of RBSs are highlighted in the end to stimulate future research and development This paper describes the design of a modular battery management system for electric off-road vehicles, where lithiumion batteries are expected to be widely used. A massive electrification of off-road vehicles can be enabled by the availability of a standard battery module, provided with an effective management unit. The design and some preliminary experimental results of the module management unit are discussed in this paper. The unit contains a high current active equalizer that enables the dynamic charge equalization among cells and maximizes the usable capacity of the battery PENGARUH BATTERY MANAGEMENT SYSTEM (BMS) PADA PENGISIAN BATERAI LITHIUM SISTEM PLT Our society is facing significant challenges due to accelerated climatic change brought by
increased carbon emissions (from cars, industries and power generation) leading to global
warming. According to the 2018 Transport and Environment report on carbon emissions
(CO2 EMISSIONS FROM CARS: the facts), the transport sector is Europe’s single biggest
source of carbon emissions contributing 27% of the European Union’s total carbon emissions
with cars and vans representing more than two thirds of this percentage. Therefore, vehicle
electrification is of utmost importance to provide an alternative to fossil fuel driven (internal
combustion engine) vehicles. Improved technology coupled with tightened emissions legislation
has continuously driven costs of vehicle electrification down making electric vehicles
more accessible.
Battery electric vehicles mostly run on Lithium-ion batteries which have high battery capacity,
very low memory effect and long lifetime. Battery Management Systems (BMS) primarily
monitor lithium-ion cells for such parameters as voltage, current, temperature and battery
states (e.g. state of; charge, health, function and power) to ensure that the batteries are
safely utilised. Poor management of cell voltage, cell temperature or battery pack current
damages the batteries and endangers the safety of vehicle users.
The major aim of this project is to design and implement a Scalable Battery Management
System (SBMS) for the scalable electric drivetrain of the Generation-3 car platform prototype
at Infotiv AB, Gothenburg, that allows re-usability, reconfiguration and extension rather than
redesign. In this thesis, we analyse the scalability aspects of modular electric vehicle BMSs
and incorporating these aspects in designing a prototype SBMS. In order to ensure a fully
scalable system implementation we apply design layering. In design layering, the scalability of
the BMS design is studied in the topological, functional, hardware and software perspectives.
In addition to technical aspects, we also analyse the cost implications of implementing such
a system.
A SBMS is implemented using a master microcontroller coordinating two module microcontrollers.
Each module micro-controller controls a battery monitor, which in turn monitors
eight cells. The layered design offers high flexibility not only in design and components, but
also in cost estimation. The thesis is arranged as follows: it begins with introduction and
theoretical sections, then design and implementation sections, and finally the analysis and
conclusion sections The institute of energy systems has developed an active balancing battery management system (BMS) prototype for up to 8 cells in series. It is capable of equalizing charge imbalances in 7SxP (Li-NMC, Li-NCA) or 8SxP (LiFePO4) battery systems.
A versatile cell-to-cell topology has been implemented, based on a multi-winding transformer which is operated either in buck/boost-mode or flyback-mode The safety, performance and durability of the Li-ion battery module are limited by the operating temperature especially in the hot temperature regions, hence the thermal management system is essential for battery module. In this paper a novel phase change material (PCM) and fin structure was proposed for the thermal management system of LiFePO4 battery module to reduce the maximum temperature and improve the temperature uniformity in high-temperature environment (40 °C). Carefully designed experiments were performed for model validation. The effects of PCM species, fin thickness, fin spacing and PCM thickness on the cooling performance of battery module were investigated numerically. The results showed that PCM-fin structure thermal management system with optimized design exhibited good thermal performance, keeping the maximum temperature of the battery surface under 51 °C at relatively high discharge rate of 3C. Moreover, by investigating the thermal behavior of PCM during discharge process and cycle test, it has been found that PCM-fin structure has the advantage of improving natural convection and heat conduction within the PCM structure, and as a result enhances heat dissipation efficiency and reduces failure risk in passive thermal management systems using PCMs The future of electric vehicles relies nearly entirely on the design, monitoring, and control of the vehicle battery and its associated systems. Along with an initial optimal design of the cell/pack-level structure, the runtime performance of the battery needs to be continuously monitored and optimized for a safe and reliable operation and prolonged life. Improved charging techniques need to be developed to protect and preserve the battery. The scope of this Special Issue is to address all the above issues by promoting innovative design concepts, modeling and state estimation techniques, charging/discharging management, and hybridization with other storage components This thesis describes the subject of Battery Management Systems (BMS), in particular the design of BMS with the aid of simulation models Over a period of some 5 years Canadian Astronautics Limited (CAL) has developed a system to autonomously manage, and thus prolong the life of, secondary storage batteries. During the development, the system was aimed at the space vehicle application using nickel cadmium batteries, but is expected to be able to enhance the life and performance of any rechargeable electrochemical couple. The system handles the cells of a battery individually and thus avoids the problems of over, and under, drive that inevitably occur in a battery of cells managed by an averaging system. This individual handling also allow cells to be totally bypassed in the event of failure, thus avoiding the losses associated with low capacity, partial short circuit, and the catastrophe of open circuit. The system has an optional capability of managing redundant batteries simultaneously, adding the advantage of on line reconditioning of one battery, while the other maintains the energy storage capability of the overall system. As developed, the system contains a dedicated, redundant, microprocessor, but the capability exists to have this computing capability time shared, or remote, and operating through a data link. As adjuncts to the basic management system CAL has developed high efficiency, polyphase, power regulators for charge and discharge power conditioning Extensive testing of a battery management system (BMS) on real battery storage system (BSS) requires lots of efforts in setting up and configuring the hardware as well as protecting the system from unpredictable faults during the test. To overcome this complexity, a hardware-in-the-loop (HIL) simulation tool is employed and integrated to the BMS test system. By using this tool, it allows to push the tested system up to the operational limits, where may incur potential faults or accidents, to examine all possible test cases within the simulation environment. In this paper, an advanced HIL-based virtual battery module (VBM), consists of one “live” cell connected in series with fifteen simulated cells, is introduced for the purposes of testing the BMS components. First, the complete cell model is built and validated using real world driving cycle while the HIL-based VBM is then exercised under an Urban Dynamometer Driving Schedule (UDDS) driving cycle to ensure it is fully working and ready for the BMS testing in real-time. Finally, commissioning of the whole system is performed to guarantee the stable operation of the system for the BMS evaluation Zips Racing Electric currently uses a bulky, off-the-shelf battery management system to monitor and manage the voltage, temperature, and state-of-charge of an electric formula-style racecar battery pack (accumulator). The objective of this project is to research current battery management methodologies and apply said research to design and create a lightweight, compact, custom battery management system that is integrated with existing vehicle systems. This will allow for cleaner accumulator packaging and improved communication between the battery management system and the rest of the vehicle This paper presents an optimal energy management for PV/battery stand-alone system. The system comprises photovoltaic array, battery, inverter and AC loads. PV array is an uncontrollable source due to the variations in irradiations and temperature. To deliver the highest point to the load a maximum power point tracking technique is used. In synchronization with battery bank the system becomes controllable. Modes of operation of the system are defined by the battery bank. Modes of operation are based on the difference between supply and load demand. This paper project proposes an optimal energy management strategy to improve the performance of the PV system. The anticipated system performance is evaluated for varying loads in MATLAB/simulink Perkembangan kendaraan listrik saat ini sedang berjalan pesat dalam industri transportasi di dunia.

The development of electric vehicles is currently running rapidly in the transportation industry in the world. Electric vehicles are vehicles that use an electric motor as a driving component. The electric motor gets a power supply from the battery. Therefore, the role of batteries is very important to operate electric vehicles. Battery Management System is a component contained in the battery pack that serves to monitor and maintain the condition of the battery so that it can operate optimally and safely. The Battery Management System has three main functions, namely the monitor to observe the conditions of the current, voltage, and temperature of the battery. Second, the Battery Management System also has a protection function to protect against interference that occurs on the battery system so that it does not have a further impact on the vehicle and the user. In addition, the Battery Management System also has a cell balancing function to keep the battery cells in balance condition when operated. The three main functions possessed by the Battery Management System are very important for the safety and lifetime of batteries and electric vehicles. Therefore, testing of the performance and safety of the equipment from the Battery Management System is needed so that later it can be ascertained that the BMS can be operated properly. In this final assignment, the standard preparation for BMS and the analysis related to the test results will be presented compared to the existing standards The second-generation hybrid and Electric Vehicles are currently leading the paradigm shift in the automobile industry, replacing conventional diesel and gasoline-powered vehicles. The Battery Management System is crucial in these electric vehicles and also essential for renewable energy storage systems. This review paper focuses on batteries and addresses concerns, difficulties, and solutions associated with them. It explores key technologies of Battery Management System, including battery modeling, state estimation, and battery charging. A thorough analysis of numerous battery models, including electric, thermal, and electro-thermal models, is provided in the article. Additionally, it surveys battery state estimations for a charge and health. Furthermore, the different battery charging approaches and optimization methods are discussed. The Battery Management System performs a wide range of tasks, including as monitoring voltage and current, estimating charge and discharge, equalizing and protecting the battery, managing temperature conditions, and managing battery data. It also looks at various cell balancing circuit types, current and voltage stressors, control reliability, power loss, efficiency, as well as their advantages and disadvantages. The paper also discusses research gaps in battery management systems.publishedVersio Uninterruptible power supplies (UPS), represented by lead-acid batteries, play an important role in various kinds of industries. They protect industrial technologies from being damaged by dangerous interruptions of an electric power supply. Advanced UPS monitoring performed by a complex battery management system (BMS) prevents the UPS from sustaining more serious damage due to its timely and accurate battery-fault detection based on voltage metering. This technique is very advanced and precise but also very expensive on a long-term basis. This article describes an experiment applying infrared thermographic measurements during a long term monitoring and fault detection in UPS. The assumption that the battery overheat implies its damaged state is the leading factor of our experiments. They are based on real measured data on various UPS battery sets and several statistical examinations confirming the high relevancy of the thermal features with mostly over 90% detection accuracy. Such a model can be used as a supplement for lead-acid battery based UPS monitoring to ensure their higher reliability under significantly lower maintenance costs.Web of Science82art. no. 18 A new heat transfer enhancement approach was proposed for the cooling system of lithium-ion batteries. A three-dimensional numerical simulation of the passive thermal management system for a battery pack was accomplished by employing ANSYS Fluent (Canonsburg, PA, USA). Phase change material was used for the thermal management of lithium-ion battery modules and as the heat transmission source to decrease battery temperature in fast charging and discharge conditions. Constant current charge and discharge were applied to lithium-ion battery modules. In the experimental part of the research, an isothermal battery calorimeter was used to determine the heat dissipation of lithium-ion batteries. Thermal performance was simulated for the presence of phase change material composites. Simulation outcomes demonstrate that phase change material cooling considerably decreases the lithium-ion battery temperature increase during fast charging and discharging conditions use. The greatest temperature at the end of 9 C, 7 C, 5 C, and 3 C charges and discharges were approximately 49.7, 44.6, 38.4, and 33.1 &deg;C, respectively, demonstrating satisfactory performance in lithium-ion battery thermal homogeneity of the passive thermal management system The success and performance of a Hybrid Electric Vehicle (HEV) relies largely on its Energy Storage System (ESS). High temperatures and thermal variations can significantly affect a battery\u27s performance and lifecycle. An effective thermal management system is vital to the health and safe operation of the ESS\u27s batteries. A well designed thermal management system begins with the accurate prediction of the   battery\u27s thermal conditions. In hot climates, HEVs may be required to operate within ten degrees Celsius of the maximum safe operating temperature of their batteries. This study aims to evaluate the thermal management system of a lithium-ion based energy storage system designed for HEV applications. The analysis uses estimated current values from powertrain simulation software, fundamental heat transfer principles, finite element analysis (FEA), and computational fluid dynamics (CFD) tools to predict the temperature distributions in battery modules Electric vehicles are showing some promises in the automotive industry and can be the answer for mitigating carbon footprint. In the process of upgrading electric vehicles to the customer demands, battery performance serves a crucial part in deciding the performance of the electric vehicles. So, Battery Management System becomes the brains behind monitoring and controlling the battery. Real-time sensing of the battery parameters, decision-making capability to choose the type of charging, and which cell to be charged are all the functionalities of BMS. All these criteria can be assessed precisely and efficiently via processors like Raspberry pi, along with IoT and cloud computing technologies. These approaches can be used for remote accessing of the battery’s performance, which will help the customer and the company to analyse the vehicle's condition. They also help prevent battery degradation. Since IoT and cloud computing technologies are being used, if an adverse state occurs in the battery, the customer can be notified directly via their mobile. In this article, a combined technology of locally hosted processor and cloud-based decision making has been discussed to improve the battery intern Electric Vehicle’s performance Different types of electric vehicles (EVs) have been recently designed with the aim of solving pollution problems caused by the emission of gasoline-powered engines. Environmental problems promote the adoption of new-generation electric vehicles for urban transportation. As it is well known, one of the weakest points of electric vehicles is the battery system. Vehicle autonomy and, therefore, accurate detection of battery state of charge (SoC) together with battery expected life, i.e., battery state of health, are among the major drawbacks that prevent the introduction of electric vehicles in the consumer market. The electric scooter may provide the most feasible opportunity among EVs. They may be a replacement product for the primary-use vehicle, especially in Europe and Asia, provided that drive performance, safety, and cost issues are similar to actual engine scooters. The battery system choice is a crucial item, and thanks to an increasing emphasis on vehicle range and performance, the Li-ion battery could become a viable candidate. This paper deals with the design of a battery pack based on Li-ion technology for a prototype electric scooter with high performance and autonomy. The adopted battery system is composed of a suitable number of cells series connected, featuring a high voltage level. Therefore, cell equalization and monitoring need to be provided. Due to manufacturing asymmetries, charge and discharge cycles lead to cell unbalancing, reducing battery capacity and, depending on cell type, causing safety troubles or strongly limiting the storage capacity of the full pack. No solution is available on the market at a cheap price, because of the required voltage level and performance, therefore, a dedicated battery management system was designed, that also includes a battery SoC monitoring. The proposed solution features a high capability of energy storing in braking conditions, charge equalization, overvoltage and undervoltage protection and, obviously, SoC information in order to optimize autonomy instead of performance or vice-versa Battery management systems (BMSs) play a critical role in the control and monitoring of battery operations, particularly for lithium-ion batteries. This thesis focuses on several key aspects of BMSs, aiming to improve their effectiveness and reliability. BMSs are essential to the control and optimization of battery performance, ensuring safety, efficiency, and longevity. This thesis focuses on strategies for control and estimation in battery systems. The challenges are posed by the complexity of lithium-ion battery systems, and only a few quantities such as temperature, current, and voltage are usually measurable.

The thesis addresses state estimation in battery systems, considering the challenges of limited number of sensors. Most used approaches in this field rely on mathematical models like Equivalent Circuit Models (ECMs) and Electrochemical Models (EMs). Novel set-based techniques, including intervals, zonotopes, and constrained zonotopes, are introduced for the first time in this field.
These set-based approaches, assuming bounded uncertainty and noise, improve fault detection and analysis. The proposed scheme, utilizing constrained zonotopes, efficiently detects thermal faults in battery cells despite unknown but bounded uncertainties, surpassing traditional methods.

Furthermore joint estimation of states and parameters in battery systems has been explored, highlighting the impact of uncertain parameters on equivalent circuit models (ECMs). The analysis emphasizes the importance of careful model selection and design for accurate estimation and observability.

The combination of accurate state parameter estimation and advanced modeling plays a crucial role in addressing control challenges in lithium batteries. This approach helps optimize charging strategies and mitigate the effects of aging.

Whitin this aspect the thesis focuses on optimizing the control of Battery Management Systems (BMSs), with a specific aim at finding the best charging strategies for lithium-ion batteries while minimizing the impact of aging.

This thesis focuses on several key aspects of BMSs, aiming to improve their effectiveness and reliability. BMSs are essential to the control and optimization of battery performance, ensuring safety, efficiency, and longevity. This thesis focuses on strategies for control and estimation in battery systems. The challenges are posed by the complexity of lithium-ion battery systems, and only a few quantities such as temperature, current, and voltage are usually measurable.

The thesis addresses state estimation in battery systems, considering the challenges of limited number of sensors. Most used approaches in this field rely on mathematical models like Equivalent Circuit Models (ECMs) and Electrochemical Models (EMs). Novel set-based techniques, including intervals, zonotopes, and constrained zonotopes, are introduced for the first time in this field.
These set-based approaches, assuming bounded uncertainty and noise, improve fault detection and analysis. The proposed scheme, utilizing constrained zonotopes, efficiently detects thermal faults in battery cells despite unknown but bounded uncertainties, surpassing traditional methods.

Furthermore joint estimation of states and parameters in battery systems has been explored, highlighting the impact of uncertain parameters on equivalent circuit models (ECMs). The analysis emphasizes the importance of careful model selection and design for accurate estimation and observability.

The combination of accurate state parameter estimation and advanced modeling plays a crucial role in addressing control challenges in lithium batteries. This approach helps optimize charging strategies and mitigate the effects of aging.

Whitin this aspect the thesis focuses on optimizing the control of Battery Management Systems (BMSs), with a specific aim at finding the best charging strategies for lithium-ion batteries while minimizing the impact of aging. The approach involves utilizing surrogate models that combine static nonlinear models dependent on the state of charge with finite-dimensional linear-time-invariant model.

Battery is one of the critical components in an Electric Vehicle. Lithium Ion Polymer battery offers better performance compare to other types of the battery in the market. However, Lithium Ion Polymer battery is very sensitive to over voltage and under voltage which can be hazardous to the user. Moreover, the imbalanced cell in a battery affects the performance and life usage of the battery. By having a proper monitoring and balanced cell, it can prolong and maintain the performance of the battery. The purpose of this work is to adopt a passive cell balancing during the charging of Lithium Ion Polymer battery. This work produces State of Charge profile of Lithium Ion Polymer battery using measured parameters such as voltage, charging current and temperature. The work on battery testing was done to calculate the State of Charge and verified using Orion Battery Management System data. In this report, findings on both methods are discussed. A prototype of passive cell balancing was designed using a PIC16F877A microcontroller. However, the prototype is still under way. Therefore, the effectiveness cannot be determined at the moment ABSTRACT The high level of energy and power density of Lithium-ion and Zinc batteries amongst electrochemical batteries such Lead acid battery etc. makes them suitable as the energy storage in electric, hybrid electric vehicle, and plug-in vehicles (EV/HEV/PHEV). The battery management system is an electronic system that manages battery. One of the requirements in electrical system is rechargeable battery and its precise management. The Battery management system (BMS) monitors very important battery parameters i.e. state of charge, state of health, coolant flow for air or fluid, ampere hour counting, terminal voltage and flowing current (in and out).Open circuit voltage and integral of discharging current of the battery be used for estimation of SOC and are the function of SOC. The on line measurement and comparison of the predicted and measured terminal voltage and integral of current provides a tool for estimating the SOC and SOH. The BMS is also used for calculating secondary reports and reporting the generated data. The BMS also helps in controlling or balancing battery environment. In this research paper attempt is made to design the battery management system for electrical system or plug-in vehicles. KEYWORDS: Battery management system (BMS), plug-in-vehicles-state of charge (SOC), state of health (SOH The establishment of an accurate battery model is of great significance to improve the reliability of electric vehicles (EVs). However, the battery is a complex electrochemical system with hardly observable and simulatable internal chemical reactions, and it is challenging to estimate the state of battery accurately. This paper proposes a novel flexible and reliable battery management method based on the battery big data platform and Cyber-Physical System (CPS) technology. First of all, to integrate the battery big data resources in the cloud, a Cyber-physical battery management framework is defined and served as the basic data platform for battery modeling issues. And to improve the quality of the collected battery data in the database, this work reports the first attempt to develop an adaptive data cleaning method for the cloud battery management issue. Furthermore, a deep learning algorithm-based feature extraction model, as well as a feature-oriented battery modeling method, is developed to mitigate the under-fitting problem and improve the accuracy of the cloud-based battery model. The actual operation data of electric buses is used to validate the proposed methodologies. The maximum data restoring error can be limited within 1.3% in the experiments, which indicates that the proposed data cleaning method is able to improve the cloud battery data quality effectively. Meanwhile, the maximum SoC estimation error in the proposed feature-oriented battery modeling method is within 2.47%, which highlights the effectiveness of the proposed method.</p Thermal management design for electric vehicles (EV) is very important in order to manage the thermal dissipated by operating components. This research aims at performing design optimization of a thermal management system for battery modules, controller and electric motor in EV. A combination of passive and active cooling systems is proposed where air cooled is used in battery modules, water cooling for controller and water jacket for electric motor. Design Failure Mode and Effect Analysis (DFMEA) method is deployed to identify the potential failure modes and causes so that improvements can be made for battery modules, controller and electric motor. The design for all of the components and the thermal management system were done with CATIA V5. The material selections process for the designs was based on the analysis using Cambridge Engineering Selector (CES EduPack). Final design was utilizing water cooled for electric motor and controller while using air cooled for battery modules. It was found that best material for electric motor and controller water jacket is with aluminum alloy 6060 while air cooled ducting using High Density Poly Ethylene (HDPE) and battery housing using Polycyclohexylenedimethylene Terephthalate (PCT). The thermal management system for battery modules is simulated using ANSYS CFD software. Results from simulation were validated with manual calculation and have shown good agreement based on the data collected at various vehicle speeds"	['21959542', '34212933', '83925877', '18944061', '18955532', '42852763', '127146772', '123103516', '108874022', '131976922', '122462980', '160966111', '52616756', '52558136', '120399914', '4854046', '148926401', '4475358', '74100949', '131107741', '85225763', '10892567', '144555611', '150393000', '32974727', '108509223', '63181581', '156120700', '4802754', '131181434', '160669689', '84254060', '100815362', '156627264', '40298254']	[[{'name': 'Chen, Chen'}, {'name': 'Guan, Shenguei'}, {'name': 'Jeong, Taikyeong'}, {'name': 'Krilavičius, Tomas'}, {'name': 'Lei, Chi-Un'}, {'name': 'Man, K.

181a047f-77f9-4e0f-b939-922840ff7498	health	Abstract effect of a synthetic Aluminium - Magnesium Silicate (AMS) on antiplasmodial activity of chloroquine was tested. Plasmodium berghei-infected mice were treated with 7 mg/kg, 5 mg/kg and 3 mg/kg chloroquine, respectively. The two subgroups in each experiment were treated with chloroquine alone and with chloroquine in AMS respectively. Parasitaemia (%) of the group treated with 7 mg/kg was higher than that of the control. At 5 mg/kg, chloroquine treatment significantly reduced parasitaemia from 3.60 to 2.46 (P =0.01). Incorporating chloroquine in AMS significantly improved its ability to reduce P. berghei parasitaemia at 5 mgkg and at 3 mg/kg, from 2.46 0.21 to 1.57 0.25 (P = 0.01) and from 3.82 0.06 to 2.12 0.08 (P =0.01 ).

Although mental health recovery models are often heralded as ideological goals, comparatively little has been documented about the means of achieving these. This article sets out the nature and content of the Whole Life Programme, used within the Hertfordshire NHS Partnership Foundation Trust, and the results of qualitative research into the programme that set out to analyse the impact of its delivery from the perspectives of service users. The research examined the experiences and views of participants receiving treatment several months after the completion of the programme, and also of those who withdrew prematurely, in order to learn from these experiences, adding to our understanding of how one recovery based approach, the Whole Life Manual, can be applied in practiceNon peer reviewedFinal Published versio Abstract:&nbsp;The aim of this study was to investigate the effectiveness of a school-based health promotion and education program in improving knowledge, attitudes, self-efficacy and behaviours of urban Indigenous young people regarding chronic disease and associated risk factors. A mixed methods approach was adopted for this evaluation; however, this paper will focus on the quantitative aspect of the study. The Deadly Choices™ health education program was delivered weekly at six education facilities in Brisbane, Australia to participants from years seven to 12 over seven weeks. One school that received the Deadly Choices program the following term acted as the control group. Questionnaire data was collected immediately pre and post intervention to assess program impact. As self-reported by participants there were mostly significant improvements over time for questions relating to knowledge, attitudes and self-efficacy regarding leadership, chronic disease and risk factors within the intervention group. There were also significant changes within the intervention group regarding breakfast frequency (P = 0.002), physical activity frequency (P ≤ 0.001), fruit (P = 0.004) and vegetable (P ≤ 0.001) intake. Overall, there were few significant differences between the control and intervention groups regarding health attitudes and behaviours; however, there were considerably more improvements relating to self-efficacy and knowledge of chronic disease and associated risk factors between groups. The program also facilitated 30 Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander health checks for participants. Deadly Choices is an innovative and comprehensive school-based program which has great potential to improve the health outcomes of Indigenous young people in urban areas by providing education in leadership and chronic disease prevention; engaging students in physical activity participation; and collaborating with health services to facilitate health checks Type 2 diabetes mellitus is an insidious disease that is increasingly present in geriatric population [1]. The greatest difficulty is represented by glycaemic control in geriatric patients often not very compliant with diet therapy and drug therapy. A new insulin glargine 300 units/ml formulation seems im- prove patient compliance due to the lower volume of insulin to be injected and improved glycaemic control over 24 hours. The HRV signal, derived from digital electrocardiographic recording, is the simplest and most imme- diate analysis that consists in calculating some temporal parameters [2]. HRV is a simple statistics derived from beat-beat intervals of sinus origin expressed as units of time in milliseconds. Data in the literature indicate that a decrease in HRV, measured with time domain analysis, denotes a worse prognosis and/or an increased risk of mortality in patients with heart disease, especially in the elderly ones Childhood obesity is on the increase and maintaining regular physical activity and consuming a healthy diet have become essential tools to combat the condition. The United Kingdom government has recommended guidelines for optimal levels of diet and activity in children. The aim of this paper is to describe and compare self-reported physical activity levels, diet, and Body Mass Indices (BMI) amongst adolescent children, aged 11-15, in the South West (SW) and North West (NW) regions of England and to see if these children were meeting the current targets for optimal levels of: physical activity; fruit/vegetable consumption; fat consumption and BMI. We report the results of a cross-sectional survey of four secondary schools and 1,869 children using the self-reported Western Australian Child and Adolescent Physical Activity and Nutrition Survey (CAPANS) physical activity instrument and a food intake screener questionnaire, in summer and winter. We found that 25% (469/1869) 95% CI: 23% to 27%, of children engaged in 60 minutes of moderate to vigorous physical activity per day; 53% (995/1866) 95% CI: 51% to 56%, took 5 portions of fruit and vegetables per day; while 22% (407/1861) 95% CI: 20% to 24% consumed recommended amount of fats, and 23.7% (276/1164) 95% CI: 21% to 26%, of pupils were obese or overweight as classified by their BMI. Self reported physical activity in young people regardless of area is lower than previously reported and the lack of students engaging in 60 minutes moderate to vigorous activity could have serious public health consequences. If sustained, this could lead to more overweight adults, and more ill health Examines the divide in the U.S. labor market between higher wage earners with health insurance, and lower wage earners who often lack coverage and access to essential health care © RCN Publishing Company Limited 2018Improving survival rates for children and young people with complex health needs requires a robust system for transition to adult services. Effective planning is essential to ensure a smooth transition process that is in the best interests of the young person and their family. This article discusses the needs and requirements for planned and purposeful transition processes to support young people with complex healthcare needs and their families. It considers the preparation of adult services, the team, the young person and their parents in line with an integrated approach and the nurse’s role. Recommendations for practice include the necessity for an integrated approach to ensure optimum outcomes and ascertaining the potential value of a nurse-led service in delivering the transition process.

To that end the microstructure of four commercial alloys with various Fe-contents (1.20-1.78%) and there laboratory melted alloys with various Fe-contents (1.5-2.5%) were investigated in the as delivered state and after three different heat treatments. Samples of these alloys were exposed to flowing natural seawater. During exposure electrochemical measurements were performed. After exposure the weight loss was determined. Moreover, for a number of samples the corrosion products were analysed by means of electron microprobe analysis. Irrespective of the Fe-content, the presence of discontinuous precipitates in the laboratory melted alloys turned out to be detrimental with regard to general corrosion. To a less extent this also holds for alloys with high concentrations of continuous precipitates, as observed for iron contents of 2 and 2.5%. The precipitate free alloys as well as the ones containing low concentrations of continuous precipitates because of low Fe-concentrations (<1.5%Fe) do show a good corrosion behaviour. The corrosion behaviour of commercial CuNi 10 Fe in the as received condition was generally comparable with that of laboratory melted alloys with continuous precipitates. The corrosion rates of the former do not exceed those of the latter, which are very low for practical applications. Finally the corrosion behaviour of five laboratory melted CuNi5 alloys, containing up to 4% fe in solution, was investigated. It turned out that their reciprocal polarisation resistance in the steady state situation is lower than those for the CuNi 10 Fe alloys In a joint effort between NASA Kennedy and LANL, electrically conductive polymer coatings were developed as corrosion protective coatings for metal surfaces. At NASA Kennedy, the launch environment consist of marine, severe solar, and intermittent high acid and/or elevated temperature conditions. Electrically conductive polymer coatings were developed which impart corrosion resistance to mild steel when exposed to saline and acidic environments. Such coatings also seem to promote corrosion resistance in areas of mild steel where scratches exist in the protective coating. Such coatings appear promising for many commercial applications The corrosion of bronzes was examined in the context of single-acid versus mixed-acid (as in urban acid rain) solutions. Two bi-component bronzes (copper with either 3% Sn or 7% Sn) that closely represent those of historic artifacts were immersed for five weeks in conditions designed to replicate those experienced by statues and ornaments in cities where rainfall and humidity constantly produce an electrolyte layer on the surfaces of bronzes. Ions, acids, and particles of pollutants can dissolve in this layer, resulting in a variety of harsh corrosion processes. The kinetics of corrosion and the properties of the resulting patinas were monitored weekly by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy and open-circuit potential measurements. The sizes and appearances of the corrosion products were monitored and used to estimate the progress of the corrosion, whose crystalline structures were visualized using scanning electron microscopy with energy dispersive spectroscopy, identified by X-ray diffraction, and characterized by spectrocolorimetry. The electrochemical measurements demonstrated that greater damage (in terms of color change and corrosion product formation) did not correspond to deficiencies in protection. The mixed-acid solution did not corrode the bronzes, as would be expected from the additive effects of the single acids. The postulated mechanisms of metal dissolution appear to be specific to a particular bronze alloy, with the tin component playing an important role Corrosion of 1100 aluminum in oxygen-saturated water at 70 degrees C under experimental conditions was studied, emphasizing effects of exposure interruption, the number of specimens, and the refreshment rate. A logarithmic equation was derived to express the corrosion rate The effects were studied of low-pressure air on contamination and corrosion in the tantalum alloy T-111/lithium system at 980 and 1260 C. Capsules of T-111 containing lithium were exposed to six vacuum levels between 1 x 10 to the 8th power and 0.0003 torr by controlled air leakage into a vacuum system. Capsules exposed at 980 C and 0.0002 torr failed from intragranular oxidation. The remainder of the capsules completed the 96-hour tests. The depth of oxygen contamination was greater at 980 C than at 1260 C. Tests made at 0.0001 and 0.00001 torr levels caused large increases in the oxygen content of the T-111. Tests at 0.000001 torr or less produced no significant contamination. No lithium corrosion of the T-111 was observed under any of the conditions Reinforced concrete (RC) structures are severely degraded due to the corrosion of the embedded reinforcing steel, and hence, the upgrading of RC structures is essential. Repairing mortar is widely used to improve durability and strengthen structures; however, further repairing might be required considering the extended life of the structure. The use of inhibitors to protect the reinforcement from corrosion has become of great interest. Therefore, it is vital to study the potential of using corrosion inhibitors in a newly repaired system.
This study investigated the performance of a commercially available polymer-modified mortar with migrating and admixed corrosion inhibitors. The study examined repair mortar\u27s fresh and mechanical properties with corrosion inhibitors using the workability, flexural strength, and compressive strength tests adopting submerged and sealed curing methods. The resistivity of reinforcement against corrosion was measured using the impressed current technique and mass loss test. The results revealed no adverse effect on the workability of repair material from the admixed corrosion inhibitor. The application of migrating corrosion inhibitor improved corrosion resistance by 29% with reduced mass loss; however, increasing the inhibitor dosage did not result in substantial changes under submerged and sealed curing conditions. On the other hand, the admixed corrosion inhibitor enhanced corrosion resistance by 15%, 28%, and 47% when the inhibitor dosage was at 0.5%, 1%, and 2%, respectively. This study proves that incorporating a corrosion inhibitor to the repair mortar in a repairing process can further delay the potential reinforcement corrosion Práce se zabývá problematikou koroze a možnostmi protikorozní ochrany ocelových konstrukcí.

Firstly, the principles and mechanisms of electrochemical corrosion are discussed along with the specific forms of corrosion and how the environment influences the corrosion process. Additionally, options for anti-corrosion control are discussed as it relates to specific steel structures. Finally, the methods of corrosion detection and monitoring are discussed. The current study investigates a ceramic, two cermets and a metal under solid-liquid impingement with 3.5% NaCl and 150mg/l hydraulic fracturing sand at two extreme angles of impact, 90° and 20°. The materials tested were Zirconia, sintered WC-6Co, sintered WC-6Ni and SS316. Each material was exposed to a testing regime using re-circulating impinging jet apparatus with a velocity of 19m/s and one hour duration. The electrochemical properties of the materials were investigated in-situ through anodic and cathodic polarisation and application of cathodic protection. Post experimental analysis of the degraded surface was completed using Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) and Optical 3D Imaging. Zirconia exhibited a brittle response to erosion-corrosion testing with the mass loss at 90° being fifty times greater than the negligible mass loss at 20°. WC-6Co and WC-6Ni both outperformed SS316 under all solid-liquid impingement erosion-corrosion testing regimes. WC-6Ni exhibited slightly better erosion-corrosion resistance over WC-6Co at both 90° and 20°. SS316 had the best corrosion resistance and showed passivation during anodic polarisations in solid-liquid impingement conditions. The nickel binder increased the corrosion resistance of WC-6Ni over WC-6Co. Cathodic protection was successfully applied on sintered WC-6Co and SS316 isolating the key components of erosion-corrosion This study focuses on the corrosion mechanism of carbon steel exposed to an artificial geothermal brine influenced by carbon dioxide (CO2) gas. The tested brine simulates a geothermal source in Sibayak, Indonesia, containing 1500 mg/L of Cl−, 20 mg/L of SO42−, and 15 mg/L of HCO3− with pH 4. To reveal the temperature effect on the corrosion behavior of carbon steel, exposure and electrochemical tests were carried out at 70 °C and 150 °C. Surface analysis of corroded specimens showed localized corrosion at both temperatures, despite the formation of corrosion products on the surface. After 7 days at 150 °C, SEM images showed the formation of an adherent, dense, and crystalline FeCO3 layer. Whereas at 70 °C, the corrosion products consisted of chukanovite (Fe2(OH)2CO3) and siderite (FeCO3), which are less dense and less protective than that at 150 °C. Control experiments under Ar-environment were used to investigate the corrosive effect of CO2. Free corrosion potential (Ecorr) and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) confirm that at both temperatures, the corrosive effect of CO2 was more significant compared to that measured in the Ar-containing solution. In terms of temperature effect, carbon steel remained active at 70 °C, while at 150 °C, it became passive due to the FeCO3 formation. These results suggest that carbon steel is more susceptible to corrosion at the near ground surface of a geothermal well, whereas at a deeper well with a higher temperature, there is a possible risk of scaling (FeCO3 layer). A longer exposure test at 150 °C with a stagnant solution for 28 days, however, showed the unstable FeCO3 layer and therefore a deeper localized corrosion compared to that of seven-day exposed specimens"	['4865713', '24865863', '134937215', '4465622', '24929039', '127813052', '16100430', '36344226', '43733259', '84129424']	[[{'name': 'Baailey'}, {'name': 'Berg'}, {'name': 'Efird'}, {'name': 'Efird'}, {'name': 'Gilbert'}, {'name': 'Ijsseling'}, {'name': 'Ijsseling'}, {'name': 'Kolster'}, {'name': 'Kolster'}, {'name': 'Macdonald'}, {'name': 'Popplewell'}, {'name': 'Pourbaix'}, {'name': 'Stewart'}, {'name': 'Swartzendruber'}, {'name': 'Syrett'}, {'name': 'Syrett'}, {'name': 'Tracy'}, {'name': 'Vreeland'}], [{'name': 'Benicewicz, Brian C.'}, {'name': 'Bryan, Coleman J.'}, {'name': 'Thompson, Karen Gebert'}, {'name': 'Wrobleski, Debra A.'}], [{'name': 'Adriaens, Mieke'}, {'name': 'Cavallini, Mauro'}, {'name': 'Gianni, Liliana'}, {'name': 'Gigante, Giovanni'}], [{'name': 'Draley, J.

3011cdc1-8f5b-4084-bf30-9330c1f2e87c	case report	An 8-year-old girl, diagnosed with mid-aortic syndrome (MAS) at the age of 2 months and under antihypertensive therapy, presented with severe systemic hypertension (&gt;200/120 mmHg). Computed tomography (CT) examination revealed aortic aneurysm between severe stenoses at pre- and infra-renal segments, and occlusion of principal splanchnic arteries with peripheral collateral revascularization. Based on CT imaging, preoperative three-dimensional (3D) anatomy was reconstructed to assess aortic dimensions and a dedicated in vitro planning platform was designed to investigate the feasibility of a stenting procedure under fluoroscopic guidance. The in vitro system was designed to incorporate a translucent flexible 3D-printed patient-specific model filled with saline. A covered 8-zig 45-mm-long Cheatham-Platinum (CP) stent and a bare 8-zig, 34-mm-long CP stent were implanted with partial overlap to treat the stenoses (global peak-to-peak pressure gradient &gt; 60 mmHg), excluding the aneurysm and avoiding risk of renal arteries occlusion. Percutaneous procedure was successfully performed with no residual pressure gradient and exactly replicating the strategy tested in vitro. Also, as investigated on the 3D-printed model, additional angioplasty was feasible across the frames of the stent to improve bilateral renal flow. Postoperative systemic pressure significantly reduced (130/70 mmHg) as well as dosage of antihypertensive therapy. This is the first report demonstrating the use of a 3D-printed model to effectively plan percutaneous intervention in a complex pediatric MAS case: taking full advantage of the combined use of a patient-specific 3D model and a dedicated in vitro platform, feasibility of the stenting procedure was successfully tested during pre-procedural assessment. Hence, use of patient-specific 3D-printed models and in vitro dedicated platforms is encouraged to assist pre-procedural planning and personalize treatment, thus enhancing intervention success We report a case of mediastinal fistula with liver abscesses detected by thoracic and abdominal computed tomography as a complication of aortic valve replacement surgery YesFP Medical students often seek case reports as vehicles for academic writing opportunities, conference presentation avenues, and residency/fellowship application highlights. Here we review a case where, due to unfortunate circumstances, a student made a unique diagnosis central to proper patient clinical care, wished to write up the case subsequently, but was ultimately excluded from the final work stemming from the patient case. We review the pitfalls that occurred in the process of pursuing publication of an interesting case, the educational value of pursuing case reports for students, the necessity for strong mentorship in this process, and general principles that medical students can follow regarding case report creation to avoid being  burned  A 4-year-old intact female domestic short-haired cat was referred for recommendations about adjuvant medical treatment 1&nbsp;month after left forelimb amputation due to periarticular histiocytic sarcoma (HS). At presentation, physical abnormalities were limited to enlarged ipsilateral superficial cervical and axillary lymph nodes. Routine blood analysis, abdominal ultrasound, and thoracic radiology were unremarkable. The cat initially received lomustine without any adverse events. Four weeks later, the cat developed severe acute respiratory distress. Results of thoracic radiographs and transthoracic echocardiographic analysis were suggestive of pulmonary and heart metastasis. Due to the cat's poor clinical condition and prognosis, the owner elected euthanasia, and a necropsy was performed. Based on gross pathology, histopathology, and immunohistochemistry, an HS with nodal, renal, pulmonary, and heart (right auricular and right ventricular) metastases was diagnosed. This case represents the first description of HS with a heart metastasis in a cat, providing further insight into the clinical course and metastatic behavior of this rare malignant neoplasm. Clinicians should be aware of this site of metastasis and consider HS in the list of differential diagnoses for secondary heart tumors in cats Pediatric cases of Spigelian hernias are rare. Only a few reports on this condition, in combination with ipsilateral cryptorchidism and testis in the hernia sac, have been published. We report on Spigelian hernia in a 3-week-old boy containing both the ipsilateral testis, without a gubernaculum and an incarcerated loop of the small intestine. It has been suggested that the combination of Spigelian hernia and ipsilateral cryptorchidism is part of a new syndrome. We discuss whether the lack of a gubernaculum and an inguinal canal reported in other similar cases may be additional elements of this new syndrome. We present a comprehensive overview of pediatric patients with Spigelian-cryptorchidism syndrome reported in the English language literature. In 75% of male infants with Spigelian hernia, there is an associated ipsilateral cryptorchidism, and in 87% of these patients, the testis is found inside the hernia sac. Thus, the surgeon dealing with a congenital Spigelian hernia should look for an undescended testis and be prepared to find it in the hernia sac	['148139055', '152278815', '12742927', '8489521', '45225606', '144839171', '3827856']	[[{'name': 'Carminati M.'}, {'name': 'Chessa M.'}, {'name': 'Formato G.

However, recent reports suggest that adults with AS feature heterogeneous cognitive profiles. The present study explores inter-individual variability in children with AS through group comparison and multiple case series analysis. All participants completed an extended battery including measures of fluid and crystallized intelligence, executive functions, theory of mind, and classical neuropsychological tests. Significant group differences were found in theory of mind and other domains related to global information processing. However, the AS group showed high inter-individual variability (both sub- and supra-normal performance) on most cognitive tasks. Furthermore, high fluid intelligence correlated with less general cognitive impairment, high cognitive flexibility, and speed of motor processing. In light of these findings, we propose that children with AS are characterized by a distinct, uneven pattern of cognitive strengths and weaknesses.Fil: González Gadea, María Luz.

Testa was an architect and urban planner but also a painter whose artistic sensitivity has been always present in the way he conceived architecture The equilibrium solutions and coarsening dynamics of strained semi-conductor
islands are investigated analytically and numerically. We develop an analytical
model to study the effect of surface energy anisotropy on the dynamics
coarsening of islands. We propose a simple model to explain the effect of this
anisotropy on the coarsening time. We find that the anisotropy slows down the
coarsening. This effect is rationalised using a quasi-analytical description of
the island profile Argentina recently completed the largest sovereign bond restructuring in history. As soon as the government announced the results of its $100 billion tender in March 2005, editorial pages worldwide heralded a new era for sovereign debt, for the emerging markets and, occasionally, for international finance. Their views on Argentina\u27s lessons were as disparate as they were definite. Some said the exchange would close the markets to middle-income countries. To others, it reaffirmed the markets\u27 resilience. Some claimed it proved the need for statutory sovereign bankruptcy. Others said it clearly discredited the idea. Most spoke too soon. The deal took months to settle, and by the time it did, it had confirmed many presumptions about emerging-market debt and shattered none. The real lessons of Argentina\u27s restructuring so far are more subtle and complex than the surrounding commentary. The default and the debt exchange were both points in a longer financial restructuring process that began before the default and will go on for years after the exchange. Argentina\u27s unorthodox debt management immediately before and after the default is partly responsible for the outcome of the exchange. With $25 billion in defaulted debt still outstanding, Argentina\u27s most important innovations may well be ahead We consider a model where a population of diffusively coupled limit-cycle
oscillators, described by the complex Ginzburg-Landau equation, interacts
nonlocally via an inertial field. For sufficiently high intensity of nonlocal
inertial coupling, the system exhibits birhythmicity with two oscillation modes
at largely different frequencies. Stability of uniform oscillations in the
birhythmic region is analyzed by means of the phase dynamics approximation.
Numerical simulations show that, depending on its parameters, the system has
irregular intermittent regimes with local bursts of synchronization or
desynchronization.Comment: 21 pages, many figures.

1df0444f-0adb-4976-a2a9-bdfe44a14498	thesis	"This research focuses on the design of pattern reconfigurable antennas and the associated circuitry. The proposed pattern reconfigurable antenna designs benefit from advantages such as maximum pattern diversity and optimum switching circuits to realise 5G reconfigurable antennas. Whereas MIMO based solutions can provide increased channel capacity, they demand high computational capability and power consumption due to multiple channel processing. This prevents their use in many applications most notably in the Internet of Things where power consumption is of key importance. A switched-beam diversity allows an energy-efficient solution improving the link budget even for small low-cost battery operated IoT/sensor network applications. The main focus of the antenna reconfiguration in this work is for switched-beam diversity. The fundamental switching elements are discussed including basic PIN diode circuits. Techniques to switch the antenna element in the feed or shorting the antenna element to the ground plane are presented. A back-to-back microstrip patch antenna with two hemispherical switchable patterns is proposed. The patch elements on a common ground plane, are switched with a single-pole double-throw PIN diode circuit. Switching the feed selects either of two identical oppositely oriented radiation patterns for maximum diversity in one plane. The identical design of the antenna elements provides similar performance control of frequency and radiation pattern in different states. This antenna provides a simple solution to cross-layer PIN diode circuit designs. A mirrored structure study provides an understanding of performance control for different switching states. A printed inverted-F antenna is presented for monopole reconfigurable antenna design. The proposed low-profile antenna consists of one main radiator and one parasitic element. By shorting the parasitic element to the ground plane using only one PIN diode, the antenna is capable of switching both the pattern and polarisation across the full bandwidth. The switched orthogonal pattern provides the maximum spatial pattern diversity and is realised using a simple structure. Then, a dual-stub coplanar Vivaldi antenna with a parasitic element is presented for the 5G mm-Wave band. The use of a dual-stub coupled between the parasitic element and two tapered slots is researched. The parasitic element shape and size is optimised to increase the realised gain. A bandpass coupled line filter is used for frequency selective features. The use of slits on the outer edge of the ground plane provides a greater maximum gain. This integrated filtenna offers lower insertion loss than the commercial DC blocks. The UWB antenna with an integrated filter can be used for harmonic suppression. The influence of the integrated filter circuit close to the antenna geometry informs the design of PIN diode circuit switching and power supply in the 5G band. Based on the filter design in the mm-Wave band, a method of designing a feasible DC power supply for the PIN diode in the mm-Wave band is studied. A printed Yagi-Uda antenna array is integrated with switching circuitry to realise a switched 180° hemispheres radiation pattern. The antenna realises a maximum diversity in one plane. The study offers the possibility to use PIN diodes in the mm-Wave band for reconfigurable antenna designs. For the presented antennas, key geometric parameters are discussed for improved understanding of the trade-offs in radiation pattern/beamwidth and gain control for reconfigurable antenna applications Fraxinus excelsior (common ash) is a hardwood tree, native to Ireland which has demonstrated adaptability to growing in a wide range of sites. In 2013, there was a total of over 20,000 hectares recorded under ash in Ireland. From an economic, ecological and carbon aspect ash is also a very important tree species. Since the arrival of Chalara disease, which has the potential to prove fatal to c.97% of the ash population there is an urgent need to consider how to preserve the remaining resistant trees and propagate new resistant lines. Grafting is the suggested method which has the capacity to produce a tree in a breeding programme which can be field planted within a year, once suitable rootstocks can be determined and produced. This thesis examined the potential for grafting two Fraxinus excelsior clones M72 and 98, chosen at random onto F. excelsior, F. paxiana, F. chinensis, F. japonica, F. platypoda, Syringa vulgaris, and Ligustrum ovalifolium rootstocks to confirm their suitability for large scale vegetative propagation. It was found that when Clone M72 and Clone 98 were grafted onto Fraxinus excelsior rootstocks the survival was 100% and 97% respectively, while the non-grafted Control returned a plant survival rate of 93%. When Clone M72 was grafted onto Fraxinus chinensis and Fraxinus paxiana rootstocks the resultant graft survival was 68% and 40% respectively. When Fraxinus platypoda and Fraxinus japonica interstocks were used for grafting Clone 98 survival was 87% and 60% respectively. When Ligustrum and Syringa rootstocks were used to propagate Clone M72 survival was 37% and 33% respectively. When Ligustrum and Syringa were used as rootstocks for Clone 98 the result was 30% and 40% respectively. Propagation by budding was not successful The mortgage arrears crisis in Ireland was and is among the most severe experienced on record and although there has been a decreasing trend in the number of mortgages in default in the past four years, it still continues to cause distress to borrowers and vulnerabilities to lenders. There are indications that one of the main factors associated with mortgage default is loan affordability, of which the level of disposable income is a driver. Additionally, guidelines set out by the European Central Bank instructed financial institutions to adopt measures to further reduce and prevent loans defaulting, including the implementation and identification of Early Warning Indicators (EWIs). Financial institutions currently adopt credit risk models in order to calculate the risk associated with customers. Therefore, this research observed a cohort of mortgage customers in Lender A over a 30-month period and utilised transactional features, explaining the use of disposable income, to expand on existing credit risk models and aid in the identification of EWIs for the mortgage portfolio. Over the course of the study three feature selection techniques were adopted, namely correlation-based analysis, random forest feature importance and decision tree feature importance. A number of transactional categories were identified including insurance spend, gambling spend, savings and the value of ATM withdrawals. Furthermore, it was found that the inclusion of transactional features in existing credit risk models statistically improved performance A system is presented here to provide improved precision in ensemble differential photometry. This is achieved by using the power of grid computing to analyse astronomical catalogues. This produces new catalogues of optimised pointings for each star, which maximise the number and quality of reference stars available. Astronomical phenomena such as exoplanet transits and small-scale structure within quasars may be observed by means of millimagnitude photometric variability on the timescale of minutes to hours. Because of atmospheric distortion, ground-based observations of these phenomena require the use of differential photometry whereby the target is compared with one or more reference stars. CCD cameras enable the use of many reference stars in an ensemble. The more closely the reference stars in this ensemble resemble the target, the greater the precision of the photometry that can be achieved. The Locus Algorithm has been developed to identify the optimum pointing for a target and provide that pointing with a score relating to the degree of similarity between target and the reference stars. It does so by identifying potential points of aim for a particular telescope such that a given target and a varying set of references were included in a field of view centred on those pointings. A score is calculated for each such pointing. For each target, the pointing with the highest score is designated the optimum pointing. The application of this system to the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) catalogue demanded the use of a High Performance Computing (HPC) solution through Grid Ireland. Pointings have thus been generated for 61,662,376 stars and 23,697 quasars Although our imagination as policy-makers, legislators, academics, and members of the general public has been captured by the promise of fitness, what is meant by it and whether or not its individualising emphasis is a good thing is much less clear. In response to this question of cultural significance, this thesis provides a phenomenology of fitness. It does so in two important senses and in the context of two distinct parts.The first half of this thesis (Chapters One and Two) is given to the task of bracketing the natural attitude with respect to fitness; that is, contextualising the question of its cultural embeddedness within processes of reflexive embodiment that are at play in modern society. “Being fit,” it is argued in this context, implies “being fit for something” (something other than health) or “being fit for someone” (someone other than oneself). And, having lost some (if not all) of its modernist illusions and its progressivist convictions to social regeneration, the task of “being fit” is framed as an ambivalent one, akin to the modern-day Sisyphus, and gestural of the self-reflexivity inherent in late-modern consumer society.By shifting the organisation of attention from ambivalence, the second half ofthis thesis (Chapters Three and Four) examines the possibilities for a positive appropriation of fitness beyond mere consumption activity. By focusing on fitness at the level of action and interaction (where meaning relates to use and practice) the second half of this thesis opens up the possibilities for a re-description of fitness (of Sisyphus) on the basis of the following proposition: fitness is something we negotiate, despite it being something we never really achieve. Findings from twelve elaborative phenomenological interviews emanating from an ethnographic orientation over a two and a half year period are given towards this end. They indicate that this thesis (Chapters Three and Four) examines the possibilities for a positive appropriation of fitness beyond mere consumption activity. By focusing on fitness at the level of action and interaction (where meaning relates to use and practice) the second half of this thesis opens up the possibilities for a re-description of fitness (of Sisyphus) on the basis of the following proposition: fitness is something we negotiate, despite it being something we never really achieve. Findings from twelve elaborative phenomenological interviews emanating from an ethnographic orientation over a two and a half year period are given towards this end. They indicate that consigning fitness to mere consumption activity overlooks the importance of participants’ meaning-making activities, their motivations, and the pleasures that accrue on the basis of ongoing activity and increased experience. They indicate that, if “doing fitness” enables individuals to become acquainted with these internal goods, then “being someone through fitness” can operate as an indexical marker of virtue.The possibilities for a Complemental Model of Health and fitness and for a novel approach to talking about the fit body are discussed in conclusion (Chapter Five) and in the context of aligning the findings of this thesis to future research and practice Enzymes such as α-amylase and xylanase offer potential for numerous industrial applications such as food, beverage, and animal feed production, detergents, textile, cosmetics and biodiesel production. Economic factors such as achievement of optimum yields and production cost are the main deterrents in the industrial use of these enzymes. Enzymes are generally produced via microbial fermentation using expensive mediums which account for 30 to 40% of the production cost. Food industry wastes such as spent coffee waste (SCW) and Brewers’ spent grain (BSG) are two of the most common food waste products expelled by the food and beverage industry here in Ireland and are environmental burden. However, these inexpensive food wastes can be utilized as a substrate for the production of enzymes, which can significantly reduce the production cost of the enzymes and also enhance the value of underutilized food waste. Based on the above facts, the aim of this study is to exploit the lignocellulosic food industry waste such as BSG and SCW for the production of industrially viable enzymes such as α-amylase and xylanase. Although high in polysaccharide content, the effective utilisation of SCW and BSG requires specific pretreatment measures that result in a decrease in recalcitrance by removal of the lignin fraction. The aim of the project was achieved through the following objectives: ▪ Identification and development of the best pretreatment strategy for SCW and BSG that would enhance their enzymatic digestibility and liberation of higher amount of fermentable sugars. ▪ Optimisation of SCW and BSG for the production of enzymes such as α-amylase and xylanase. The effect of the pretreatments was primarily analysed as changes that occurred in the composition of SCW and BSG. A number of analytical techniques were used to characterise the pretreated waste samples, including FTIR, FESEM, XRD and DSC In recent years, Genetically Modified (GM) foods have become increasingly common on our supermarket shelves. Consumer concerns regarding their safety have prompted codes of practice and legislation requiring labelling of all GM-food-containing products. Labelling requires some means of verification. There is no simple means of detecting GM food and until recently, there were no tests available. The object of this study was to develop a simple, rapid and user-friendly method of detecting genetically modified foods. The study concentrated on the detection of GM tomatoes, using a commercially available tomato paste. The method of choice was the Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) targeting the selectable marker gene Neomycin Phosphotransferase II (NPTII). The selectable marker gene confers resistance to the antibiotic kanamycin, and is used to detect newly transformed plants in the laboratory. NPT II has commonly been used as a selectable marker and therefore can be used to test for many species of transgenic plants. A PCR method to detect NPT II was developed and applied to genetically modified tomato paste. Commonly used plant DNA extraction methods proved unsuitable and an extraction method based on microwave treatment of the paste was developed. This increased both the sensitivity and reproducibility of the PCR method. It was also attempted to develop a method to detect genetically modified soy using PCR, by targeting the cauliflower mosaic virus promoter gene In this thesis we consider the geometry of the Hilbert scheme of points in
P^n, concentrating on the locus of points corresponding to the Gorenstein
subschemes of P^n. New results are given, most importantly we provide tools for
constructing flat families and analysis of finite Gorenstein algebras and
expose their efficiency by proving smoothability of certain families of
algebras. Much of the existing theory and folklore is reviewed, providing a
micro-encyclopaedic reference.Comment: v2: some minor corrections made. 29 pages. This is an MSc thesis done
  on the University of Warsaw; my adviser is Jaros{\l}aw Buczy\'nsk This research explored the acquisition of English by Programme Chechen refugees who arrived in Ireland ten years ago. Very many of them had less than a basic level of English. To meet the language needs of the newly arrived Chechen Programme refugees an intensive English course was set up by the local Vocational Education Committee. However, refugees’ basic needs such as health care, parental care took precedence over language provision. The research found that they were unable to fully participate in and benefit from the course. The process of acquiring English happened to a large extent outside the classroom. This research also looked at how the Chechens have acquired language outside the classroom and within their social environment since their initial English language course. The collective case study research with a qualitative approach produced a number of findings that complemented each other. The findings from the assessments, the questionnaire, the semi-structured interviews, individual case studies and notes made from empirical observation all reinforced each other. The experiences of the individual personalities which became apparent in the individual case studies also shared a lot in common. This research has shown that the Chechens in Roscommon town have become well integrated; they are independent and plan to stay. Most of them speak English quite well and are continuing to improve by participating in local society. Based on the results of this research, it is recommended that the initial language course for programme refugees should be set up at an appropriate time for them, after a period of time for settlement"	['84231130', '84234435', '84229476', '84229466', '84228795', '128968618', '84231476', '17137770', '84232847']	[[{'name': 'Yang, Kansheng, [Thesis]'}], [{'name': 'McNamara, John, [Thesis]'}], [{'name': 'Finn, Donal, [Thesis]'}], [{'name': 'Creaner, Oisin, [Thesis]'}], [{'name': 'Neville, Ross, (Thesis)'}], [{'name': 'RAVINDRAN, RAJEEV, [Thesis]'}], [{'name': 'Boyce, Olivia, (Thesis)'}], [{'name': 'Adviser Jarosław Buczyński'}, {'name': 'Joachim Jelisiejew'}, {'name': 'Msc Thesis'}], [{'name': 'Rose, Liana, [Thesis]'}]]	['The Study of Reconfigurable Antennas and Associated Circuitry', 'The Effects of Intraspecific, interSpecific, and Intergeneric Grafting on the Growth and Development of Fraxinus Excelsior Scions', 'An Investigation into the Predictive Capability of Customer Spending in Modelling Mortgage Default', 'Data Mining by Grid Computing in the Search for Extrasolar Planets', 'A PHENOMENOLOGY OF FITNESS FROM CONSUMPTION TO VIRTUOUS PRODUCTION', 'Agro-industrial Lignocellulosic Biomass: A Sustainable Platform for the Production of α-amylase and xylanase A', 'Detection of Genetically Modified Foods', 'Deformations of zero-dimensional schemes and applications', 'English Language Acquisition by Chechen Programme Refugees in Roscommon, Ireland']	9.0	exploratory	0.5

12947e59-8b2c-448e-a267-5d5b7b3015a2	j12 - marriage marital dissolution family structure domestic abuse	Using U.S. Census data for the years 1960-1980, we study the impact of unilateral divorce on outcomes of children (age 6-15) and their mothers. We find that the reform increased mothers' divorce, decreased family income and increased the fraction of mothers below the poverty line. For children, we find not only negative results on investment, measured as the probability that a child goes to a private school, but also on child outcomes, measured by the likelihood of children aged 0-4 being held back in school at the time of the reform. We then analyze outcomes of the same cohorts of children 10 years later, by studying young men and women aged 16-25 using the 1970-1990 U.S. Census. We find an increase in marginality for these cohorts, measured as the probability of living in an institution (men) or the probability of being below the poverty line (women). We find that the impact in outcomes is particularly important for black children and young adults The fraction of marriages between South Korean males and brides from other Asian countries has sharply increased since 1990 reaching around 10% of new marriages in 2005. We employ a large data set collected in 2012 to investigate the impact of citizenship acquisition of these brides on their bargaining power in the household and labor market. We employ propensity score matching using detailed information of brides, their spouses, and households required for nationality application. Our results show that legal entitlement of marriage immigrants raises the chance of being hired as a regular worker and increases decision power in a household. The findings in this paper imply that a legal framework is an important determinant of the bargaining power of immigrants in the labor market and households.JEL Classification Codes: J12, J15, J18http://www.grips.ac.jp/list/jp/facultyinfo/wie-dainn Economic decisions frequently entail choices in the presence of risk. Decisions to purchase insurance, to save, to invest, and to pursue an education are all choices that may involve some degree of risk, just to name a few. We analyze the impact of changes in family structure on individuals' willingness to take risk (WTR). We find evidence that separating from a partner is associated with an increase in the WTR; while the birth of a first child is associated with a decrease in the WTR. Interestingly, these changes are temporary and the WTR returns to the level observed before the family event within 1–2 years following the event. Married individuals are more risk averse and this does not change with the passage of time of the actual wedding. Providing long term care is also associated with a higher WTR longitudinal data. ISER incorporates the following centres: • ESRC Research Centre on Micro-social Change. Established in 1989 to identify, explain, model and forecast social change in Britain at the individual and household level, the Centre specialises in research using longitudinal data. • ESRC UK Longitudinal Centre. This national resource centre was established in October 1999 to promote the use of longitudinal data and to develop a strategy for the future of large-scale longitudinal surveys. It was responsible for the British Household Panel Survey (BHPS) and for the ESRC’s interest in the National Child Development Study and the 1970 British Cohort Study • European Centre for Analysis in the Social Sciences. ECASS is an interdisciplinary research centre which hosts major research programmes and helps researchers from the EU gain access to longitudinal data and cross-national datasets from all over Europe. The British Household Panel Survey is one of the main instruments for measuring social change in Britain. The BHPS comprises a nationally representative sample of around 5,500 households and over 10,000 individuals who are reinterviewed each year. The questionnaire includes a constant core of items accompanied by a variable component in order to provide for the collection of initial condition The determinants of marital instability is an important area of research for demography, sociology and economics, with a host of public policy outcomes being significantly affected by family breakdown. This paper improves our understanding of the issue through the use of rich longitudinal data and the application of advanced research approaches. In both method and data terms our approach represents a significant advance in this research area. Using data from waves 1–7 of HILDA, 2,482 married couples—where both partners are respondents in the first wave—are traced over six years to identify factors associated with marital instability. The data are analysed dyadically; that is, the characteristics of both partners in each couple are considered in tandem. This allows assessment of whether marriages between partners with similar characteristics (homogamy) are more likely to last than are marriages between dissimilar partners, or whether particular characteristics of wives or husbands—independent of their partners’—are more strongly associated with marital stability. A Cox proportional hazards model with time-varying covariates is used to assess the association of characteristics with marital separation. We find the following factors are associated with higher risk of marital separation: spousal differences in age, education, preference for a(nother) child, and drinking and smoking behaviours; dissatisfaction with the relationship; low household income; husband’s unemployment and perceived financial stress; young age at marriage; separation of parents; second-plus marriage; and resident children born before marriage.marriage, marital separation, divorce, Australia, dyadic, homogamy	['158261976', '28399035', '142797682', '158293652', '23006981', '2524249']	[[{'name': 'Cáceres-Delpiano, Julio'}, {'name': 'Giolito, Eugenio P.'}], [{'name': 'Korea University, Seoul, Korea'}, {'name': 'LEE Hanol'}, {'name': 'WIE Dainn'}, {'name': '政策研究大学院大学 / National Graduate Institute for Policy Studies'}], [{'name': 'Browne, Mark J.'}, {'name': 'Jäger, Verena'}, {'name': 'Richter, Andreas'}, {'name': 'Steinorth, Petra'}], [{'name': 'Eliason, Marcus'}], [{'name': 'Au Yong Lyn, Audrey'}], [{'name': 'Bruce Chapman'}, {'name': 'Peng Yu'}, {'name': 'Rebecca Kippen'}]]	"['How unilateral divorce affects children', 'Legal Entitlement and Bargaining Power of Marriage Immigrants in Korea', 'Family changes and the willingness to take risks', 'Lost jobs, broken marriages', 'Essays in applied microeconometrics: Evidence from Mexico', ""What's love got to do with it?

26a9c323-0fbf-4ec6-800b-1ad5541b71b5	energy drinks	"Background: The consumption of liquid calories has been implicated in the development of obesity and weight gain. Energy-containing drinks are often reported to have a weak satiety value: one explanation for this is that because of their fluid texture they are not expected to have much nutritional value. It is important to consider what features of these drinks can be manipulated to enhance their expected satiety value. Two studies investigated the perception of subtle changes in a drink’s viscosity, and the extent to which thick texture and creamy flavour contribute to the generation of satiety expectations. Participants in the first study rated the sensory characteristics of 16 fruit yogurt drinks of increasing viscosity. In study two, a new set of participants evaluated eight versions of the fruit yogurt drink, which varied in thick texture, creamy flavour and energy content, for sensory and hedonic characteristics and satiety expectations.

Results: In study one, participants were able to perceive small changes in drink viscosity that were strongly related to the actual viscosity of the drinks. In study two, the thick versions of the drink were expected to be more filling and have a greater expected satiety value, independent of the drink’s actual energy content. A creamy flavour enhanced the extent to which the drink was expected to be filling, but did not affect its expected satiety.

Conclusions: These results indicate that subtle manipulations of texture and creamy flavour can increase expectations that a fruit yogurt drink will be filling and suppress hunger, irrespective of the drink’s energy content. A thicker texture enhanced expectations of satiety to a greater extent than a creamier flavour, and may be one way to improve the anticipated satiating value of energy-containing beverages Energy drink usage as a stimulant is on the rise among adolescents and young adults. While these drinks have positive energizing effects, they pose significant health concerns. This paper examines the adverse cardiovascular effects of energy drinks and the components that could possibly be responsible. Analysis was conducted by reviewing and comparing many studies available in this area of research. Studies of energy drinks in general and energy drinks versus drinks containing caffeine alone were analyzed. Additionally, this review investigated studies of the specific ingredients in energy drinks such as caffeine, taurine, guarana, and sugar. This review found that energy drinks cause varying degrees of adverse cardiovascular effects when consumed in specific dosages. While the highest levels of consumption led to arrythmias, syncope and death, lower levels led to increased QTc interval and increased blood pressure. Longer lasting effects of energy drinks, such as possible energy-drink induced hypertension, were also uncovered. The effects of energy drinks were deemed greater than those caused by caffeine alone. When analyzing energy drinks’ ingredients, caffeine, sugar, and guarana were found likely responsible for the adverse effects of energy drinks, while the effect taurine was less convincing. Overall, while energy drinks were found to be safe in small and infrequent amounts, significant public health concerns were related to increased and habitual use Adolescents are labeled as sensitive to caffeine, though despite this predisposition, consumption is high among this population. Energy drinks are a current trend in soft-drink-like beverages and are marketed to 11-35 year olds. However, unlike soft drinks, energy drinks are not regulated by the Food and Drug Administration, and therefore do not have to limit their caffeine content. This cross-sectional, correlational study sought to identify the role that knowledge, attitudes, and peers play in adolescent energy drink consumption. Adolescents (n = 199), ages 18 to 21, at a university in the west were surveyed. Descriptive statistics revealed that 25% of the surveyed population reported consuming at least one energy drink in the last 30 days. Using binary logistic regression, it was determined that having seen warning labels on energy drink cans significantly reduced the odds that the participant would consume energy drinks (p \u3c .01). Interestingly, having more negative attitudes toward caffeine increased the odds the individual would consume energy drinks (p \u3c .01). Additionally, the more individuals disagreed that they drank energy drinks with friends, the more likely they were to drink energy drinks (p \u3c .01). Being male significantly increased the odds that the individual would consume energy drinks (p \u3c .01). Moreover, there was a significant interactive effect between having a negative attitude toward caffeine and the fewer friends they had that drank energy drinks, resulting in an increased odds the individual consumed energy drinks (p \u3c .05). Hopefully, the results from this study will contribute to the current energy drink research Energy drinks are popular among young individuals andmarketed to college students, athletes, and active individualsbetween the ages of 21 and 35 years. In the beginningconsumption of energy drinks can significantlyimprove physical and mental performance. Energy drinkscontain a mixture of compounds, of which caffeine, guarana,and herbal supplements such as ginkgo and ginsengare major components. Unfortunately, the body ofliterature is limited and it is not known whether these improvementsare due to the caffeine other herbal ingredients.Severe clinical manifestations may occur after useof energy drinks with alcohol The aim of this article is risingawareness about the ingredients of energy drinks andclinical manifestations that may occur after usage and updateabout knowledge.Key words: Energy drinks, energy drinks ingredients,clinical manifestation Objectives: To explore the consumption patterns of energy drinks and associated factors, amongst medical students and foundation year doctors in Malta.
Methods: Data was collected from medical students and foundation year doctors from the Faculty of Medicine and Surgery, University of Malta, by means of an electronically administered cross-sectional, self-reported survey. The response rate was 42% (n=305). IBM SPSS 23 was used for statistical analysis.
Results:


Energy drinks consumption amongst the sample was 68.2% (n= 208). Most participants (60.1%) started consuming energy drinks between 16-20 years, followed by those between 11-15 years (34.6%). Males are more likely to consume energy drinks than females. Participants who consume energy drinks are more likely to also drink coffee (85.1%), alcohol (88.0%) and smoke tobacco (18.3%). Common reasons for drinking energy drinks were for mixing with alcohol (37.5%) and during studying/major projects (30.8%). The majority of the participants (52.1%) experience psychological side effects due to energy drinks, the most common being stimulating/hyperactivity (42.6%), followed by anxiety (14.8%). Over half of the participants (54.8%) claimed to suffer from physical side effects
Conclusions: Energy drink consumption is common amongst this population and certain aspects of consumption are a cause for concern. Greater public education of the risks of these drinks is recommended especially to young age groups. Legislation may be required to control the marketing and sales and accessibility of these drinks.peer-reviewe"	['4403844', '64196580', '7377113', '12057492', '77457438']	[[{'name': 'A Drewnowski'}, {'name': 'A Tournier'}, {'name': 'AJ Crum'}, {'name': 'AJ Stunkard'}, {'name': 'AL Koliandris'}, {'name': 'B Piqueras-Fiszman'}, {'name': 'BA Cassady'}, {'name': 'C de Graaf'}, {'name': 'CK Martin'}, {'name': 'DA Booth'}, {'name': 'DJ Shide'}, {'name': 'DM Mourao'}, {'name': 'E Almiron-Roig'}, {'name': 'E Almiron-Roig'}, {'name': 'F Shama'}, {'name': 'HJ Leidy'}, {'name': 'J Blundell'}, {'name': 'JE Cecil'}, {'name': 'JE Cecil'}, {'name': 'JM Brunstrom'}, {'name': 'JM Brunstrom'}, {'name': 'JM Brunstrom'}, {'name': 'JM Brunstrom'}, {'name': 'KJ Rudenga'}, {'name': 'L Marciani'}, {'name': 'LL Birch'}, {'name': 'M Mars'}, {'name': 'MC Bourne'}, {'name': 'MF Picciano'}, {'name': 'MR Yeomans'}, {'name': 'MR Yeomans'}, {'name': 'MR Yeomans'}, {'name': 'N Zijlstra'}, {'name': 'N Zijlstra'}, {'name': 'OW Wooley'}, {'name': 'P Sherman'}, {'name': 'PS Hogenkamp'}, {'name': 'R Mattes'}, {'name': 'RA de Wijk'}, {'name': 'RD Mattes'}, {'name': 'RD Mattes'}, {'name': 'RD Mattes'}, {'name': 'RD Mattes'}, {'name': 'RD Mattes'}, {'name': 'S Ibrugger'}, {'name': 'SA Giduck'}, {'name': 'SC Woods'}, {'name': 'SE Shaffer'}, {'name': 'SE Swithers'}, {'name': 'SE Swithers'}, {'name': 'SV Kirkmeyer'}, {'name': 'SW Ng'}, {'name': 'T Hulshof'}, {'name': 'TL Davidson'}, {'name': 'Y Wu'}], [{'name': 'Gelbfish, Malka B.'}], [{'name': 'Ward, Alyson C.'}], [{'name': 'Ali Kutlucan'}, {'name': 'Leyla Yılmaz Aydın'}, {'name': 'Nurten Ercan'}, {'name': 'Süber Dikici'}], [{'name': 'Axiak, Sally'}, {'name': 'Grech, Anton'}, {'name': 'Pace, Lara'}, {'name': 'Vella Fondacaro, Daniel'}]]	['Subtle changes in the flavour and texture of a drink enhance expectations of satiety', 'Energy Drinks: Cardiovascular Effects and the Specific Components Responsible', 'The Impact of Knowledge, Attitudes, and Peer Influence on Adolescent Energy Drink Consumption', 'What do we know about energy drinks?', 'A survey of energy drinks consumption amongst medical students and foundation year doctors in Malta']	5.0	exploratory	0.5

However, many students are found who do not reflect noble morals. one of the behaviors that do not reflect noble morals is academic cheating.  Academic fraud is dishonest behavior by students in learning. The causes of academic cheating include academic pressure and academic ability. Great academic pressure and academic ability make students commit academic fraud. This study aims to prove the correlation between academic pressure and academic ability to academic fraud committed by students. The research subjects were active students of the Faculty of Psychology. Type of correlational quantitative research with a scale as a Likert model research instrument. Sampling using purposive random sampling of as many as 191 subjects. Data were collected using measuring instruments in the form of an academic pressure scale, academic ability scale, and academic cheating scale in the form of Google Forms. Data analysis using multiple regression. The results of the data analysis showed that academic pressure and academic ability impact on of academic fraud with a significant value of p = 0.000 (0.000 < 0.005). Academic pressure and academic ability impact academic fraud by 35.3%, and the remaining 64.7% is influenced by other factors. The results showed that the greater the academic pressure and academic ability in students, the greater the academic fraud that occurs.Pendidikan merupakan serana mencerdaskan anak bangsa yang berilmu dan berakhlak mulia.

9a98861b-17f2-4a2b-a753-d1c635f50b02	sadat weapon	"This study seeks to analyze the role of oil in Saudi Arabia\u27s foreign policy. In 1973 Saudi Arabia and other Arab nations successfully used their oil resources to apply pressure on the United States of America to modify her strong support of the State of Israel. Saudi Arabia played a significant role in the 1973 oil embargo. This thesis will examine Saudi Arabia\u27s role in the 1973-74 Arab oil embargo, and what prompted her participation, considering the fact that she is less radical than most of her Arab neighbors. The 1973 oil embargo was more successful than for example the 1967 embargo; Saudi Arabia\u27s participation helped to create this difference. The oil weapon will definitely be effective whenever applied uniformly by the Arabs against the west, especially now, and possibly in the near future. However, it will be unwise for the Arabs to continuously depend on the oil weapon since their oil resources cannot last forever. As Dr. Sheikh Rustum Ali stated in his book entitled Saudi Arabia and Oil Diplomacy, alternative energy resources are still abundant. The western hemisphere or industrialized nations need only to apply their financial resources and technology to develop these resources. It obviously won\u27t be an easy task for them to do so, now or in the near future, however it could be done. When this becomes a reality, the demand for oil will be sharply reduced, which will in turn deprive it of its present significance and of its role as a political weapon in international affairs.
This study will examine the alternative sources of energy being developed in the west, notably nuclear energy. Nuclear energy plants are rapidly being built in the western industrialized nations despite some oppositions by citizen groups within these various nations. There is evidence that these projects are favourable to some oil producing nations, including Saudi Arabia. Efficient use of energy is currently an important issue among the industrialized as well as the non-industrialized nations. The interest for alternative sources of energy is growing, partially due to higher oil prices. The high price of oil is forcing the United States for example (a victim of the 1973 Arab oil embargo) to rapidly seek alternative as well as new sources of energy.
Solar energy is another alternative source of energy being developed. This along with nuclear energy could be significant alternatives to oil successfully developed.
The major propositions that will be supported in this thesis are: Saudi Arabia fully supported the 1973 oil embargo, (1) to show her support of the muslim Arab nations, thus promoting unity among them; (2) to show her fear of Israel\u27s ideological stand, which she considers too extreme, and radical; (3) to have Israel withdraw from Arab lands occupied during the 1967 war; (4) to gain respect and recognition from the western industrialized nations; (5) to take up a leadership role among the Arab nations in the Middle East, since her participation was crucial to the success of the embargo. Saudi Arabia has the largest known oil reserves in the world During the 2008 spike in oil prices, oil companies and government officials were brought under close scrutiny as many Americans began to question why prices were able to rise so quickly.  Americans had become accustomed to living in an economy where cheap oil was the norm, and demanded answers when that situation changed.  What most of them did not know is that they were repeating history and mimicking the response to the 1973 oil embargo.  Just as in 2008, the United States faced a crisis in 1973 with which it was unprepared to effectively cope.  This thesis analyzes the reasons for and consequences of this lack of preparation in 1973 drawing on the writings of major policy makers and leaders of the time, most notably Henry Kissinger, Anwar el-Sadat, and Richard Nixon, Senate hearings testimony, recently declassified government documents detailing plans for U.S. invasion, and contemporary newspapers which recorded public perception.  I argue that decades of living with cheaply priced oil, an over reliance on multinational corporations and a lack of understanding of Middle Eastern resentment toward these oil companies, combined with a fundamental misunderstanding of how oil and politics could be linked brought the United States to the ultimate near-decision of invading the Middle East.
The 1973 oil embargo brought the United States face-to-face with the consequences of reliance on foreign oil and with the hardships that resulted from it.  The United States had relied on oil companies to manage their interests in the Middle East for decades but in 1973 the situation changed forever.  I close by considering the ongoing deep ties between the United States and the Middle East that are present still.  The same problems that existed in 1973 exist today, and until those are corrected the United States and its economy will be deeply tied to the Middle East and to events in the region Volume 77, Issue 28https://scholarworks.sjsu.edu/spartandaily/6804/thumbnail.jp Special Edition issue - Terrorism and Counter-Terrorism in Sub-Saharan AfricaThis paper presents a comparative analysis of the Niger Delta amnesty programme and the proposed amnesty for Boko Haram insurgents in Nigeria. The motivation for comparing the two groups derives from the growing demand from some notable groups and individuals, mainly from the northern part of Nigeria, that the Boko Haram insurgents be granted amnesty just as the Niger Delta armed militants. One of such strong voices in favour of amnesty for Boko Haram insurgents is the Sultan of Sokoto, AlhajiSa’adAbubakar, who, on the 7th of March 2013, called for “total and unconditional” amnesty for Boko Haram. Sultan Abubakar’s demand has attracted mixed reaction as it is largely supported by the northern group-Arewa Consultative Forum (ACF) and rejected by others such as the Christian Association of Nigeria (CAN). The most serious reaction comes from the presidency in its commission, on April 24th 2013, of a presidential Committee on Dialogue and Peaceful Resolution of Security Challenges in the North. After an extension by 2 months of its initial 90 days task, the Turaki-led Committee on Dialogue and Peaceful Resolution of Security Challenges in the North has finally submitted its recommendations to the president. Two key recommendations are: the need to set up an advisory committee for continuous dialogue with Boko Haram (as the leadership of Boko Haram refused to dialogue) and a victims’ support fund to help victims of Boko Haram.Publisher PD A global economic crisis is the most difficult kind of event to predict. This article asks a straightforward question: did anyone come close
to anticipating the oil crisis of 1973/74, which represented a new type of historical sequence? Was the likelihood of an oil shock self-evident at the time? To answer this, I examine the degree of awareness in Europe and the United States of the three possible triggering factors: Egypt’s disposition to start a war and enlist the support of oil-producers; the Arab interest in oil conservation and long-term income maximization; and the imbalance in the oil market and the delayed adjustment of oil prices. For each of these topics, I set out both what was expected and what was actually in the offing; the information available to Western analysts and that unknown; the communication noises and the flagrant bias. The conclusion pays tribute to three men – James Akins, Pierre Wack, and Ted Newland – who had guessed what was coming ahead, and explains why their predictions almost succeeded, while others failed Volume 77, Issue 28https://scholarworks.sjsu.edu/spartandaily/6804/thumbnail.jp Volume 77, Issue 28https://scholarworks.sjsu.edu/spartandaily/6804/thumbnail.jp"	['50646098', '14409994', '145837565', '18676276', '24537448', '127812161', '140316992']	[[{'name': 'Jallow, Momodou Abdou Rahman'}], [{'name': 'Chilcote, Jonathan D.'}], [{'name': 'San Jose State University, School of Journalism and Mass Communications'}], [{'name': 'Nwankpa, Michael'}], [{'name': 'Madureira, Nuno Luis'}]]	['Petroleum as a Political Weapon in International Affairs: The Case of Saudi Arabia', 'All the Crises Reached a Concerted Crescendo  - The Arab Oil Embargo and Why the United States Was Unprepared for It', 'Spartan Daily, October 12, 1981', 'The politics of amnesty in Nigeria: a comparative analysis of the Boko Haram and Niger Delta insurgencies', 'Waiting for the energy crisis: Europe and the United\r\nStates on the eve of the first oil shock']	7.0	exploratory	0.5

e8e0f945-32d6-420d-86cb-1d314afb4c45	danza	"En este artículo se analiza la asociación establecida en el imaginario occidental entre danza oriental y la danza de Salomé, enmarcada en el Orientalismo producido por la expansión colonial europea. Para ello se han estudiado los fragmentos que se refieren a esta danza en las obras de Gustave Flaubert, “Herodias”, y Oscar Wilde, Salomé. Tras el estreno de esta última se desencadenó la Salomanía, moda que a comienzos del siglo XX popularizó las representaciones de la danza de Salomé tanto en teatro como en cine por su reclamo exótico y erótico. Posteriormente, en algunas capitales de Medio Oriente, aún bajo el dominio colonial, se desarrolló la disciplina que hoy se conoce como danza oriental, adaptando las pautas del cabaret y el cine metropolitanos a las manifestaciones tradicionales de danza, aquéllas mismas que previamente habían inspirado las fantasías orientales europeas y americanas La figura de Tórtola Valencia se presenta como una personalidad renovadora en el panorama de la danza internacional cuyo legado aunque ha pasado desapercibido puede ser entendido como una contribución a la danza moderna, obteniendo sus mayores éxitos en el mundo hispano. Tórtola Valencia no intentaba reformar la danza como sí lo hizo lsadora Duncan. En vez de eso se concentró en desarrollar una danza derivada de sus sentimientos personales, ideas y experiencias espirituales sobre la antigüedad. Su repertorio de carácter ecléctico, abarca la danza española, la interpretación personal de lo clásico y la reconstrucción intuitiva de la danza histórica. En el primer caso contribuye a la popularización del estilo español en la línea de la danza teatral estilizada próxima a Antonia Mercé. Plásticamente es cercana a la concepción de «Danza Ornamental» de principios de siglo. Pero iba más allá al intentar universalizar la experiencia vital en sus danzas a través de lo que llamó «el estilo natural» y buscando en la historia el motivo inicial sobre el que trabajar a la vez que el pretexto de calidad para sus evoluciones. En este sentido comparte actitudes de fondo con la Nueva Danza desarrollada en el contexto alemán del primer tercio del siglo XX, tanto en aspectos de su proceso creativo y motivaciones como en el hecho de que no haya un estilo unificado o un vocabulario específico de pasos y movimientos para transmitir a posteriores generaciones A fourfold use of Wittgenstein’s later philosophy in order to tackle fundamental conceptual misconceptions in the domain of dance practice is proposed: the extension to dance of the insights of his remarks on other arts, the application to dance instructions of his method of examination of the use of language, the extension to dance of the insights of his remarks on aesthetics, and the use of some of the fundamental concepts of his later philosophy, such as “aspect-seeing”, or “form of life”. In the first section, Wittgenstein’s paragraphs on Shakespeare are used in order to clarify the nature of representation, his remarks on architecture are used to shed light on the gestural character of a dance movement and to differentiate dance movement from mere bodily movement, and his remarks on music are used in order to elucidate the relation ship between a movement and its so called meaning. In the second section, an analysis looks at how language is used in the dance studio to tackle the problem of affectation in dance practice, and to propose measures to overcome this tendency, such as awareness of the use of the mirror in the studio. In the third section, Wittgenstein’s understanding of aesthetic
satisfaction as something that clicks is understood as a tool to fight dualistic tendencies in dance practice. The fourth section discusses
how insight into Wittgenstein’s concepts of “aspect-seeing” and “form of life” can contribute to superseding affectation. In dance, aspect seeing involves directing one’s gaze back to the movement in question. Instead of blaming the incorrect execution of a movement on a lack of dramatic skill on the part of the dancer, an approach that reinforces the idea of dance performance as a dualistic process, it can be attributed to aspect blindness, allowing for the redirection of the dancer’s attention to the movement. In this regard, it is proposed that dancers be helped to appreciate that a movement is charged with the atmosphere of a whole form of life. By understanding this relationship, it should become clear for dancers that expressivity is something that depends neither on their mental state nor on their ability to transfer the latter to the movement in question.Propongo un uso cuádruple de la filosofía madura de Wittgenstein con vistas a abordar confusiones conceptuales fundamentales en el ámbito de la práctica de la danza: extender a la danza aquellas de sus observaciones perspicaces sobre otras artes que sean relevantes, aplicar a las instrucciones de danza su análisis del uso del lenguaje, extender a la danza sus observaciones sobre la estética y usar en el contexto de la danza algunos de los conceptos fundamentales de su filosofía madura, tales como el de «ver aspectos» o el de «forma de vida». En la primera sección, se usan los parágrafos sobre Shakespeare de Wittgenstein para clarificar la naturaleza de la representación, sus observaciones sobre arquitectura para arrojar luz sobre el carácter gestual del movimiento de danza y para diferenciar un movimiento de danza de un simple movimiento corporal. Asimismo, sus observaciones sobre música se usan con el fin de dilucidar la relación entre un
movimiento y su presunto significado. En la segunda sección, analizo cómo se usa el lenguaje en el estudio de danza con vistas a afrontar el problema de la afectación en la práctica de la danza y propongo una serie de medidas con el propósito de superar esta tendencia, como, por ejemplo, tomar conciencia del uso del espejo en el estudio de danza. En la tercera sección, la comprensión de Wittgenstein de la satisfacción estética como algo que hace click se propone como herramienta para encarar las tendencias dualistas en la práctica de la danza. La cuarta sección enfoca cómo la familiaridad con los conceptos de Wittgenstein de «ver aspectos» y «forma de vida» puede contribuir a superar la afectación. En la danza, ver aspectos supone reencauzar la mirada, enfocando de nuevo el movimiento en cuestión. En lugar de echar la culpa de una ejecución incorrecta de un movimiento a una falta de talento dramático por parte del bailarín, idea que refuerza la imagen de la representación de danza como un proceso dualista, se podría atribuir a la ceguera para los aspectos, y así reorientar la atención del bailarín al movimiento. De igual modo, se propone que los bailarines deberían ser llevados a apreciar que un movimiento ha de participar de la atmósfera de toda una forma de vida. Tras comprender esta relación, para el bailarín debería resultar evidente que la expresividad no es algo que dependa de su estado mental, ni de su habilidad para transferir ese estado mental al movimiento en cuestión Contiene imágenesEl presente trabajo transmite las vivencias de un proceso de investigación arduo y satisfactorio, poniendo a prueba los conocimientos adquiridos en la licenciatura ya que los integrantes y encargados de la danza escribieron y pidieron se anexara en la tesis dos de los documentos que expresan acuerdos y condiciones para obtener información, participación para ser interpretada y analizar, se recomienda ver anexos en las páginas 115 y 117.Fusionar la danza con una práctica cultural, en la que intervienen o representan factores como la historia, costumbres, tradiciones, economía, estos forman la cultura, para nosotros forma parte ed ser una representación cultural del pueblo de Tepexpan, corroborar que la danza puede funcionar como un fenómeno social que derrame información observable. Para comprobarlo basamos nuestro trabajo en el método etnográfico, adquiriendo información permitiendonos describir el suceso histórico y contextual de la danza, dirigiendonos al análisis y manifestar a la danza como un factor representativo de la cultura de un pueblo, en este caso es Tepexpan. Las entrevistas y la observación nos acerco, durante  casi un año, a la danza, a las personas que tienen la responsabilidad por preservarla, y esforzándose por documentarla. Por lo tanto, el trabajo de campo facilito la asimilación de la existencia de datos exactos y escritos sobre el origen de la danza, esta rázon nos acerco a darnos cuenta que la danza no contaba con el registro de notación coreográfica que sirve como preservación de la danza. Pra nosotros es importante tener el dato escrito e la notación coreográfica, ya que es un documento que fácilita la observación e análisis de dinámicas, movimientos corporales de la danza, asi que nos dimos a la tarea de  realizar este documento Durante este trabajo de investigación se ha analizado la relación existente entre las
diferentes dimensiones del autoconcepto tales como habilidad, condición y atractivo
físico, fuerza, autoconcepto físico general y autoconcepto general, con respecto a la
práctica o no de la danza, en estudiantes de educación primaria. Se han relacionado
estos dos temas por la importancia que tienen, de un lado, el autoconcepto para la
formación de la identidad de la persona y por otro lado, la danza vista como ejercicio
físico. Para llevarlo a cabo, se ha evaluado una muestra de 56 estudiantes entre 5 y 10
años de edad en los que se aplicó el Cuestionario de Autoconcepto Físico (CAF) y un
cuestionario de actividad física.
Los resultados han sido concluyentes, ya que ha quedado patente que aun siendo los
niños y niñas de menor edad los que conjugan la práctica de danza junto a la actividad
física estos tienen un autoconcepto mucho más definido que aquellos estudiantes que no
practican danza. Además, en otro aspecto del estudio, nos ha dado como resultado que
todos aquellos que aúnan danza y deportes realizan a lo largo de la semana muchas más
horas de actividad física con respecto al grupo que solo practica deportes, de esta
manera adquieren un mayor beneficio para su salud.
Tras analizar las pruebas obtenidas se abre un espacio para considerar a la danza como
estrategia de mediación eficaz para la mejora del autoconcepto. En la labor que se
llevará a cabo quedará patente que la danza además de mejorar capacidades motrices
beneficia el desarrollo en relaciones sociales y expresión de emociones. También
quedará de manifiesto cómo capta este grupo de escolares la percepción relativa que
tienen de sus capacidades, concluyendo en que la danza como estrategia de intervención
mejora el autoconcepto físico y aumenta la autopercepción de sus propias habilidades.Universidad de Sevilla.

During 1972 and early 1973, several methods of determining population size were investigated as mechanisms for estimating the spawning population size of Pacific mackerel stocks north of Punta Eugenia, Baja California,

and a method using tagging procedures proved to be the most acceptable. The estimate of the Pacific mackerel spawning population obtained by tagging procedures was 5,480 tons. This estimate agrees generally with those obtained

from alternate methods in which previously computed spawning biomass estimates were correlated with partyboat catches in three different areas and the 1973 spawning biomass estimated from the resulting regression line. The estimates

derived by these alternate methods are 6,970 tons, 4,730 tons, and 6,210 tons.

All estimates are below the 10,000 ton spawning population minimum and thus there is no excess by which a harvest under Section 8388.5 of the Fish and Game Code could be allowed. (17pp. Baltic cod spawning takes place in the deep basins and reproduction success is mainly

related to environmental conditions (salinity and oxygen regimes, i.e. the 'reproduction volume'). Due to the Baltic Sea heterogeneity, cod reproduction success in the Southem and Centrat Baltic spawning grounds can differ significantly. Recent oceanographic changes i.e. decrease of water exchange and stagnation, as weil as a strong reduction of spawning stock caused the diminishing of the reproduction

potential of the Gotland spawning grounds. The Gotland spawning grounds belong to four main cod spawning sites in the Baltic and historical analyses revealed that abundant generations of Baltic cod were produced when successful cod reproduction took place also in the Gotland Basin.

Analyses of revised reproduction volume estimates for the Gotland Basin taking into

account the spatial structure of hydrology in the basin during stagnation and aeration

periods reveals high seasonal and inter-annual variability. To describe changes of abundance and distribution of the spawning stock and the recruits in relation to hydrographic conditions, results from trawl surveys carried out in 1975-1998 in the Gotland Deep are analyzed. In this analysis, the reproduction volume is used as a proxy for the environmental conditions The 1987-88 spawning biomass estimate of Pacific herring,

Clupea harengus pallasi, in San Francisco Bay is nearly

69,000 tons. This is the fourth consecutive year that the

San Francisco Bay population has increased, after reaching a

low point of 40,000 tons in 1984.

In Tomales Bay the 1987-88 herring spawning biomass was

estimated at 2,061 tons. During the past five seasons, the

Tomales Bay spawning biomass has been low in even years and

high in odd years, indicating that spawning herring are not

returning to Tomales Bay consistently.

In San Francisco Bay, over 42,000 tons of herring spawned in

January. Similarly, 90% of Tomales Bay herring spawned in

January. No spawns were found during March in either bay.

For the first time, in San Francisco Bay, no herring spawned

in the Belvedere, Tiburon, or Angel Island areas. In

addition, herring spawning was found in the Oakland-Alameda

area for the first time and over 95% of all spawning occurred in the southern part of San Francisco Bay.

During the past six seasons in San Francisco Bay, over 70% of all spawning escapement has been in the southern part of the bay. For the nine seasons prior to that, 94% of all spawning escapement was in the northern part of the bay.  (31pp. The 1989-90 spawning biomass estimate of Pacific herring,

Clupea pallasi, from spawning-ground surveys in San

Francisco Bay was 71,000 tons, a 5,000 ton increase over the 1988-89 biomass estimate of 66,000 tons. The San Francisco Bay herring biomass has been on an upward cycle since 1984, and results from spawning-ground surveys indicated that the population was at its highest level in eight years.

In Tomales Bay the 1989-90 herring spawning biomass estimate was 345 tons. This was the third consecutive poor season.  Herring have nearly abandoned Tomales Bay, and reduced freshwater in flows due to the current drought condition in California were the probable cause for the change in spawning behavior.

An additional 445 tons were found in Bodega Bay by

hydroacoustic surveys. The total herring biomass estimate

for Tomales-Bodega area was 790 tons.

January was the month of peak spawning activity in San

Francisco Bay, with 30,000 tons of herring spawning during

the month. In Tomales there was only one spawning run; it

occurred on January 31, 1990.

In San Francisco Bay, 67% of all spawning occurred along 

the San Francisco waterfront, and only 6% of all spawning

activity was in the northern part of the bay. No spawning

was found near Tiburon, Belvedere, Richmond, Berkeley,

Candlestick Point, Sierra Point, Oyster Point, or Coyote

Point.

A total of 3.5 million m2 of eelgrass, Zoster marina, was

measured in Tomales Bay this season, a decline of about

10% over the past two seasons.

Eelgrass density kg/m2 did not change significantly this

season.  (34pp. Diurnal periodicity of spawning in the perch so far are rather meagre and found to be partly contrary to experiences of perch anglers. Therefore a study was made on the spawning during a 5-day period in the spring of 1971 in the Kuusamo area. Observations were made during the main spawning season, between 4- 9 June 1971. The perch were often measured, weighed and then released back into the water. The differences between spawning and non-spawning perch were studied as well as the time of roe discharge in a 24 hour period.

Feeds N.F., A., B and C. contained 1.21% fish oil + 5.59% vegetable oil; 1.21% fish oil + 7.39% vegetable oil; 1.21% fish oil + 9.09% vegetable oil; 1.21% fish oil + 10.89% vegetable oil respectively. Results of feeding trial showed that growth was best in the group fed diets containing 10.89% vegetable oil and least in those containing 9.09% vegetable oi One of the environmental issues facing the society is the separation of oil from water in emulsions. Oily wastewater enters into the environment through many ways such as oil spill as well as from the industry. Natural fibers are a viable alternative to synthetic fibers in separating oil from the water. The oil physical characteristics and sorbents made from the fiber influences the sorption of oil onto the fiber. This work uses the naturally available bamboo fibers for separation of oil from water. Very high adsorption capacities were obtained for vegetable oil. Furthermore, recovery of oil was also tested and 90% recovery was obtained. Bamboo fiber has thus great advantage in treating oil-water mixture This study examines the response of stock markets to oil price volatilities in Japan, Singapore, Korea and Malaysia by applying the generalized impulse response and variance decomposition analyses to the monthly data spanning 1986:01 – 2011:02. The results suggest that the reaction of stock markets to oil price shocks varies significantly across markets. Specifically, the stock market responds positively in Japan while negatively in Malaysia; the signal in Singapore and South Korea is unclear. We find that the stock market inefficiency, among others, appeared to have slowed the responses of the stock market to aggregate shocks such as oil price surges.oil price fluctuation, stock return, exchange rate, emerging market, VAR model. Annually, thousands of oil spills occur across the globe. As a result, petroleum substances and petrochemical compounds are widespread contaminants causing concern due to their toxicity and recalcitrance. Many remediation strategies have been developed using both physicochemical and biological approaches. Biological strategies are most benign, aiming to enhance microbial metabolic activities by supplying limiting inorganic nutrients, electron acceptors or donors, thus stimulating oxidation or reduction of contaminants. A key issue is controlling the supply of electron donors/acceptors. Bioelectrochemical systems (BES) have emerged, in which an electrical current serves as either electron donor or acceptor for oil spill bioremediation. BES are highly controllable and can possibly also serve as biosensors for real time monitoring of the degradation process. Despite being promising, multiple aspects need to be considered to make BES suitable for field applications including system design, electrode materials, operational parameters, mode of action and radius of influence. The microbiological processes, involved in bioelectrochemical contaminant degradation, are currently not fully understood, particularly in relation to electron transfer mechanisms. Especially in sulfate rich environments, the sulfur cycle appears pivotal during hydrocarbon oxidation.

Here we use a genome-scale model of human cell metabolism to investigate the potential metabolic alterations in cells using net zero ATP glycolysis. We uncover a novel pathway for ATP generation that involves reactions from the serine biosynthesis and one-carbon metabolism pathways. This pathway has a predicted two-fold higher flux rate in cells using net zero ATP glycolysis than those using standard glycolysis and generates twice as much ATP with significantly lower rate of lactate- but higher rate of alanine secretion. Thus, in cells using the standard- or the net zero ATP glycolysis pathways a significant portion of the glycolysis flux is always associated with ATP generation, and the ratio between the flux rates of the two pathways determines the rate of ATP generation and lactate and alanine secretion during glycolysis Recent experimental evidence indicates that some cancer cells have an alternative glycolysis pathway with net zero ATP production, implying that upregulation of glycolysis in these cells may not be related to the generation of ATP.

To identify HAMLET's bacterial targets, here we used Streptococcus pneumoniae as a model organism and employed a proteomic approach that identified several potential candidates. Two of these targets were the glycolytic enzymes fructose bis-phosphate aldolase (FBPA) and glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH). Treatment of pneumococci with HAMLET immediately inhibited their ATP and lactate production, suggesting that HAMLET inhibits glycolysis. This observation was supported by experiments with recombinant bacterial enzymes, along with biochemical and bacterial viability assays, indicating that HAMLET's activity is partially inhibited by high glucose-mediated stimulation of glycolysis but enhanced in the presence of the glycolysis inhibitor 2-deoxyglucose. Both HAMLET and ALA bound directly to each glycolytic enzyme in solution and solid phase assays and effectively inhibited their enzymatic activities. In contrast, oleic acid alone had little to no inhibitory activity. However, ALA alone also exhibited no bactericidal activity and did not block glycolysis in whole cells, suggesting a role for the lipid moiety in the internalization of HAMLET into the bacterial cells to reach its target(s). This was verified by inhibition of enzyme activity in whole cells after HAMLET but not ALA exposure. The results of this study suggest that part of HAMLET's antibacterial activity relates to its ability to target and inhibit glycolytic enzymes, providing an example of a natural antimicrobial agent that specifically targets glycolysis Glycolysis was reported to have a positive correlation with radioresistance. Our previous study found that the miR-33a functioned as a tumor suppressor in malignant melanoma by targeting hypoxia-inducible factor1-alpha (HIF-1α), a gene known to promote glycolysis. However, the role of miR-33a-5p in radiosensitivity remains to be elucidated. We found that miR-33a-5p was downregulated in melanoma tissues and cells. Cell proliferation was downregulated after overexpression of miR-33a-5p in WM451 cells, accompanied by a decreased level of glycolysis. In contrast, cell proliferation was upregulated after inhibition of miR-33a-5p in WM35 cells, accompanied by increased glycolysis. Overexpression of miR-33a-5p enhanced the sensitivity of melanoma cells to X-radiation by MTT assay, while downregulation of miR-33a-5p had the opposite effects. Finally, in vivo experiments with xenografts in nude mice confirmed that high expression of miR-33a-5p in tumor cells increased radiosensitivity via inhibiting glycolysis. In conclusions, miR-33a-5p promotes radiosensitivity by negatively regulating glycolysis in melanoma Adult stem cells demonstrate metabolic flexibility that is regulated by cell adhesion status. The authors demonstrate that adherent cells primarily utilize glycolysis, whereas suspended cells rely on oxidative phosphorylation for their ATP needs. Akt phosphorylation transduces adhesion-mediated regulation of energy metabolism, by regulating translocation of glucose transporters (GLUT1) to the cell membrane and thus, cellular glucose uptake and glycolysis. Cell dissociation, a pre-requisite for cell transplantation, leads to energetic stress, which is mediated by Akt dephosphorylation, downregulation of glucose uptake, and glycolysis. They designed hydrogels that promote rapid cell adhesion of encapsulated cells, Akt phosphorylation, restore glycolysis, and cellular ATP levels OBJECTIVES: The Warburg effect, the switch from aerobic energy production to anaerobic glycolysis, promotes tumour proliferation and motility by inducing acidification of the tumour microenvironment. Therapies that reduce acidity could impair tumour growth and invasiveness. I analyse the dynamics of cell proliferation and of resistance to therapies that target acidity in a population of cells under the Warburg effect. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The dynamics of mutant cells with increased glycolysis and motility is analysed in a multi-player game with collective interactions in the framework of evolutionary game theory. Perturbations of the level of acidity in the microenvironment are used to simulate the effect of therapies that target glycolysis. RESULTS: The non-linear effects of glycolysis induce frequency-dependent clonal selection leading to the coexistence of glycolytic and non-glycolytic cells within the tumour. Mutants with increased motility can invade such polymorphic population and spread within the tumour. While reducing acidity may produce a sudden reduction in tumour proliferation, frequency-dependent selection enables the tumour to adapt to the new conditions and can enable the tumour to restore the original levels of growth and invasiveness. CONCLUSIONS: The acidity produced by glycolysis acts as a non-linear public good that leads to the coexistence of cells with high and low glycolysis within the tumour. Such heterogeneous population can easily adapt to changes in acidity. Therapies that target acidity can only be effective in the long term if the cost of glycolysis is high, that is, under non-limiting oxygen concentrations. Their efficacy, therefore, is reduced when combined with therapies that impair angiogenesis Glioblastoma (GBM) stem cells (GSCs) reside in both hypoxic and vascular microenvironments within tumors. The molecular mechanisms that allow GSCs to occupy such contrasting niches are not understood. We used patient-derived GBM cultures to identify GSC subtypes with differential activation of Notch signaling, which co-exist in tumors but occupy distinct niches and match their metabolism accordingly. Multipotent GSCs with Notch pathway activation reside in perivascular niches, and are unable to entrain anaerobic glycolysis during hypoxia. In contrast, most CD133-expressing GSCs do not depend on canonical Notch signaling, populate tumors regardless of local vascularity and selectively utilize anaerobic glycolysis to expand in hypoxia. Ectopic activation of Notch signaling in CD133-expressing GSCs is sufficient to suppress anaerobic glycolysis and resistance to hypoxia. These findings demonstrate a novel role for Notch signaling in regulating GSC metabolism and suggest intratumoral GSC heterogeneity ensures metabolic adaptations to support tumor growth in diverse tumor microenvironments Cancer cells exhibit high rates of glycolysis and glutaminolysis. Glycolysis can provide energy and glutaminolysis can provide carbon for anaplerosis and reductive carboxylation to citrate. However, all these metabolic requirements could be in principle satisfied from glucose. Here we investigate why cancer cells do not satisfy their metabolic demands using aerobic biosynthesis from glucose. Based on the typical composition of a mammalian cell we quantify the energy demand and the OxPhos burden of cell biosynthesis from glucose. Our calculation demonstrates that aerobic growth from glucose is feasible up to a minimum doubling time that is proportional to the OxPhos burden and inversely proportional to the mitochondria OxPhos capacity. To grow faster cancer cells must activate aerobic glycolysis for energy generation and uncouple NADH generation from biosynthesis. To uncouple biosynthesis from NADH generation cancer cells can synthesize lipids from carbon sources that do not produce NADH in their catabolism, including acetate and the amino acids glutamate, glutamine, phenylalanine and tyrosine. Finally, we show that cancer cell lines have an OxPhos capacity that is insufficient to support aerobic biosynthesis from glucose. We conclude that selection for high rate of biosynthesis implies a selection for aerobic glycolysis and uncoupling biosynthesis from NADH generation	['315390', '481430', '40438297', '85862831', '40435987', '8695354', '85863991', '45604889']	[[{'name': 'Alexei Vazquez'}, {'name': 'Elke K.

b44ffc75-f28c-4133-b10e-430dda9e410e	wagner terrorist	The exacerbation of terrorism in Sahelian West and Central Africa and the presence of foreign legions in aid of counterterrorism has generated research interest in private military companies (PMCs) as legions, including drone legions. This article discusses the French Legion in Mali, PMC Wagner in Central Africa Republic (CAR) and United States (US) drone legions in Sahelian West and Central Africa which is entirely francophone. French Legion disengagements from counterterrorism assignments in Mali and CAR due to increasing operational challenges compounded by policy disagreements with host governments or political disenchantment, also ushered in PMC Wagner, while US drone PMCs provided surveillance and intelligence. The choreography between France’s hard-line policy not to negotiate with terrorists and Mali’s decision to negotiate with terrorists, points to a gradual development across governmental, non-governmental and military circles home and abroad rather than an overnight policy switch against the French. The consensus going forward is a cautious dialogue with the terrorists. Meanwhile, Wagner incursions across Africa have re-ignited Cold War East–West competition for African alliances. With the proliferation of legion presence, African militaries have become actors in the foreign policy agendas of whichever legions they host, whether French, Russian or American. However, there are no guarantees yet that drone operators would protect drone hosts from terrorist backlash This paper examines whether the labor market prospects of Arab men in England are influenced by recent Islamistic terrorist attacks and the war on Iraq. We use data from the British Labour Force Survey from Spring 2001 to Winter 2006 and treat the terrorist attacks on the USA on September 11th, 2001, the Madrid train bombings on March 11th, 2004 and the London bombings on July 7th, 2005, as well as the beginning of the war on Iraq on March 20th, 2003, as natural experiments that may have lead to a change in attitudes toward Arab or Muslim men. Using treatment group definitions based on ethnicity, country of birth, current nationality, and religion, evidence from regression-adjusted dierence-in-dierences-estimators indicates that the real wages, hours worked and employment probabilities of Arab men were unchanged by the attacks. This finding is in line with prior evidence from Europe.Discrimination, September 11th, Islamistic terror, employment, wages This paper seeks to analyse cultural trauma theories and their consequences as well as their potential applicability to cases of collective trauma where access to the legal arena in the rehabilitation process is not possible. When ‘state terror’ occurs, such as in Latin America, or, more arguably Italy, access to the legal arena is systematically denied through a variety of criminal strategies. In these cases, the cultural working through of trauma takes place on the aesthetic level. What are the consequences of this process both for the inscription of the crucial event in public discourse and for its relationship with justice? Moreover, how do aesthetic codes affect the public definition of justice and a collective understanding of what happened?Publisher PD @ 2012 by the Regents of the University of California. All rights reserved.The article analyzes prohibitions on membership in terrorist organizations and examines their justifiability. It begins by providing a definition of a terrorist organization. It then describes the far-reaching modern prohibitions on membership in terrorist organizations in various jurisdictions. The article goes on to provide a doctrinal analysis of membership offenses. Based on similarities with conspiracy doctrine, membership offenses are analyzed as expansions of attempt law or, in some cases, of complicity doctrines. The justfiability of this expansion is examined. The article introduces a distinction between exclusively terrorist organizations, passive membership of which can be legitimately prohibited under certain conditions, and ancillary and dual-purpose organizations, passive membership of which cannot be legitimately prohibited. Next, the justiflability ofprohibiting more active forms of membership in each of these types of organizations is discussed. Last, guidelines for the legislation of appropriate prohibitions are proposed New security threats have emerged as major new areas of policy development in the European Union, especially during the 'war on terror'. This paper makes two significant points that counter theoretical expectations of EU counter-terrorism. Both are derived from an analysis of empirical events of EU practice. Firstly, it argues that it is vital to analyse EU institutional actor behaviour in the process of 'constructing security threats', especially when dealing with the responses to international terrorism. Secondly, despite the importance of member states in the European Union, institutional actors such as the European Commission or the Council Secretariat are increasingly gaining in importance. The Commission can (though not always does) play a significant role in this process - the role of a supranational policy entrepreneur. Yet, it is not alone in this - the Council Secretariat can also add to the notion of policy entrepreneurship at the EU level. This argument reveals shortcomings of intergovernmental understanding of European integration in the area of counter-terrorism. The paper analyses different dimensions of EU counter-terrorism, its legal and political construction, and demonstrates the significance of supranational policy entrepreneurs in the political adoption process The relationships between threat and right-wing attitudes and ethnic prejudice were investigated in a heterogeneous sample (N = 588). Specifically, we considered the perception of economic and terroristic threats in terms of their consequences at the societal and personal level. Previous studies revealed that societal consequences of threat, rather than personal consequences, are related to right-wing attitudes (e.g. Dallago & Roccato, 2010; Feldman & Stenner, 1997; Stevens, Bishin, & Barr, 2006). However, the present results challenge these findings. More specifically, three important results emerged. First, items probing into the distinct threat levels loaded on separate dimensions for both economic and terroristic threat, validating the distinction between societal and personal threat consequences. Second, consistent with previous research, this study revealed that perceived societal consequences of threat yield strong and robust relationships with all target variables. However, personal consequences of threat were also associated with higher levels of RWA, SDO, and ethnic prejudice in particular. Third, societal and personal consequences of threat interacted in explaining the target variables. More specifically, feeling personally threatened by terrorism was only related to higher levels of RWA in the presence of low levels of threat to society, whereas experiencing personal economic threat was only related to higher levels of SDO and ethnic prejudice when high societal economic threat was experienced. In sum, although the perception of societal consequences of threat plays a prominent role in explaining right-wing attitudes and ethnic prejudice, the perception of being personally affected by threat is also associated with higher levels of RWA and SDO, and especially ethnic prejudice	['140012120', '2786600', '42933018', '18674777', '7131235', '537817', '31261986']	[[{'name': 'Amoah, Michael'}], [{'name': 'Nils Braakmann'}], [{'name': 'Haesebrouck, Tim'}], [{'name': 'Tota, Anna Lisa'}], [{'name': 'Levanon, L'}], [{'name': 'Kaunert, C'}], [{'name': 'Onraet, Emma'}, {'name': 'Van Hiel, Alain'}]]	['Private military companies, foreign legions and counterterrorism in Mali and Central African Republic', 'Islamistic Terror, the War on Iraq and the Job Prospects of Arab Men in Britain: Does a Country’s Direct Involvement Matter?', 'Democratic participation in the air strikes against Islamic state : a qualitative comparative analysis', 'How to transform a ‘place of violence’ into a ‘space of collective remembering’: Italy and its traumatic past', 'Criminal prohibitions on membership in terrorist organizations', 'Towards supranational governance in EU counter-terrorism? - The role of the Commission and the Council Secretariat', 'When threat to society becomes a threat to oneself: implications for right-wing attitudes and ethnic prejudice']	7.0	exploratory	0.5

  (10 included); late David Finkelstein was very fond of the new information-theoretic paradigm of
physics advocated by John Archibald Wheeler and Richard Feynman. Only recently,
however, the paradigm has concretely shown its full power, with the derivation
of quantum theory (Chiribella et al., Phys. Rev. A 84:012311, 2011; D'Ariano et
al., 2017) and of free quantum field theory (D'Ariano and Perinotti, Phys. Rev.
A 90:062106, 2014; Bisio et al., Phys. Rev. A 88:032301, 2013; Bisio et al.,
Ann. Phys. 354:244, 2015; Bisio et al., Ann. Phys. 368:177, 2016) from
informational principles. The paradigm has opened for the first time the
possibility of avoiding physical primitives in the axioms of the physical
theory, allowing a refoundation of the whole physics over logically solid
grounds. In addition to such methodological value, the new
information-theoretic derivation of quantum field theory is particularly
interesting for establishing a theoretical framework for quantum gravity, with
the idea of obtaining gravity itself as emergent from the quantum information
processing, as also suggested by the role played by information in the
holographic principle (Susskind, J. Math. Phys. 36:6377, 1995; Bousso, Rev.
Mod. Phys. 74:825, 2002). In this paper I review how free quantum field theory
is derived without using mechanical primitives, including space-time, special
relativity, Hamiltonians, and quantization rules. The theory is simply provided
by the simplest quantum algorithm encompassing a countable set of quantum
systems whose network of interactions satisfies the three following simple
principles: homogeneity, locality, and isotropy. The inherent discrete nature
of the informational derivation leads to an extension of quantum field theory
in terms of a quantum cellular automata and quantum walks. A simple heuristic
argument sets the scale to the Planck one, and the observed regime is that of
small wavevectors ...Comment: 34 pages, 8 figures. Paper for in memoriam of David Finkelstei The propagation of light-pulse with negative group-velocity in a nonlinear
medium is studied theoretically. We show that the necessary conditions for
these effects to be observable are realized in a three-level $\Lambda$-system
interacting with a linearly polarized laser beam in the presence of a static
magnetic field. In low power regime, when all other nonlinear processes are
negligible, the light-induced Zeeman coherence cancels the resonant absorption
of the medium almost completely, but preserves the dispersion anomalous and
very high. As a result, a superluminal light pulse propagation can be observed
in the sense that the peak of the transmitted pulse exits the medium before the
peak of the incident pulse enters. There is no violation of causality and
energy conservation. Moreover, the superluminal effects are prominently
manifested in the reshaping of pulse, which is caused by the
intensity-dependent pulse velocity. Unlike the shock wave formation in a
nonlinear medium with normal dispersion, here, the self-steepening of the pulse
trailing edge takes place due to the fact that the more intense parts of the
pulse travel slower. The predicted effect can be easily observed in the well
known schemes employed for studying of nonlinear magneto-optical rotation. The
upper bound of sample length is found from the criterion that the pulse
self-steepening and group-advance time are observable without pulse distortion
caused by the group-velocity dispersion.Comment: 16 pages, 7 figure We present the first large-scale simulations of an ultracold, neutral plasma,
produced by photoionization of laser-cooled xenon atoms, from creation to
initial expansion, using classical molecular dynamics methods with open
boundary conditions. We reproduce many of the experimental findings such as the
trapping efficiency of electrons with increased ion number, a minimum electron
temperature achieved on approach to the photoionization threshold, and
recombination into Rydberg states of anomalously-low principal quantum number.
In addition, many of these effects establish themselves very early in the
plasma evolution ($\sim$ ns) before present experimental observations begin.Comment: 4 pages, 3 figures, submitted to PR Systematic inaccuracy is inherent in any computational estimate of a
non-linear average, due to the availability of only a finite number of data
values, N. Free energy differences (DF) between two states or systems are
critically important examples of such averages in physical, chemical and
biological settings. Previous work has demonstrated, empirically, that the
``finite-sampling error'' can be very large -- many times kT -- in DF estimates
for simple molecular systems. Here, we present a theoretical description of the
inaccuracy, including the exact solution of a sample problem, the precise
asymptotic behavior in terms of 1/N for large N, the identification of
universal law, and numerical illustrations. The theory relies on corrections to
the central and other limit theorems, and thus a role is played by stable
(Levy) probability distributions.Comment: 5 pages, 4 figure The serious study of such science fiction staples as wormholes, time travel,

realistic solutions within General Relativity is reviewed.Comment: 10 pages LaTeX; to appear in Phi Kappa Phi Foru We have conducted a survey of young single and multiple systems in the Taurus–Auriga star-forming region with the Atacama Large Millimeter Array (ALMA), substantially improving both the spatial resolution and sensitivity with which individual protoplanetary disks in these systems have been observed. These ALMA observations can resolve binary separations as small as 25–30 au and have an average 3σ detection level of 0.35 mJy, equivalent to a disk mass of 4 × 10−5 M ⊙ for an M3 star. Our sample was constructed from stars that have an infrared excess and/or signs of accretion and have been classified as Class II. For the binary and higher-order multiple systems observed, we detect λ = 1.3 mm continuum emission from one or more stars in all of our target systems. Combined with previous surveys of Taurus, our 21 new detections increase the fraction of millimeter-detected disks to over 75% in all categories of stars (singles, primaries, and companions) earlier than spectral type M6 in the Class II sample. Given the wealth of other information available for these stars, this has allowed us to study the impact of multiplicity with a much larger sample. While millimeter flux and disk mass are related to stellar mass as seen in previous studies, we find that both primary and secondary stars in binary systems with separations of 30–4200 au have lower values of millimeter flux as a function of stellar mass than single stars. We also find that for these systems, the circumstellar disk around the primary star does not dominate the total disk mass in the system and contains on average 62% of the total mass Magnetic reconnection is widely believed responsible for heating the solar corona as well as for generating X-rays and energetic particles in solar flares. On astrophysical scales, reconnection in the intergalactic plasma is a prime candidate for a local source (Mpc) of cosmic rays exceeding the Greisen-Zatsepin-Kuzmin cutoff (&SIM;10(19) eV). In a laboratory astrophysics experiment, we have made the first observation of particles accelerated by magnetic reconnection events to energies significantly above both the thermal and the characteristic magnetohydrodynamic energies. These particles are correlated temporally and spatially with the formation of three-dimensional magnetic structures in the reconnection region We report measurements of excess electron mobility in dense Argon gas at the
two temperatures $T=152.15$ and 162.30 K, fairly close to the critical one
($T_c =150.7$ K), as a function of the gas density $N$ up to 14
atoms$\cdot$nm$^{-3}$ ($N_{c}=8.08$ atoms$\cdot$nm$^{-3}$). For the first time
a maximum of the zero-field density-normalized mobility $\mu_{0}N$ has been
observed at the same density where it was detected in liquid Argon under
saturated vapor pressure conditions. The existence of the $\mu_{0}N$ maximum in
the liquid is commonly attributed to electrons scattering off long-wavelength
collective modes of the fluid, while for the low-density gas a density-modified
kinetic model is valid. The presence of the $\mu_{0}N$ maximum also in the gas
phase raises therefore the question whether the single scattering picture valid
in the gas is valid even at liquid densities.Comment: 21 pages, 9 figures, accepted for publication in J. Electrostatic A striking correlation has recently been observed between global cloud cover
and the flux of incident cosmic rays. The effect of natural variations in the
cosmic ray flux is large, causing estimated changes in the Earth's energy
radiation balance that are comparable to those attributed to greenhouse gases
from the burning of fossil fuels since the Industrial Revolution. However a
direct link between cosmic rays and cloud formation has not been unambiguously
established. We therefore propose to experimentally measure cloud (water
droplet) formation under controlled conditions in a test beam at CERN with a
CLOUD chamber, duplicating the conditions prevailing in the troposphere. These
data, which have never been previously obtained, will allow a detailed
understanding of the possible effects of cosmic rays on clouds and confirm, or
otherwise, a direct link between cosmic rays, global cloud cover and the
Earth's climate. The measurements will, in turn, allow more reliable
calculations to be made of the residual effect on global temperatures of the
burning of fossil fuels, an issue of profound importance to society.
Furthermore, light radio-isotope records indicate a correlation has existed
between global climate and the cosmic ray flux extending back over the present
inter-glacial and perhaps earlier. This suggests it may eventually become
possible to make long-term (10-1,000 year) predictions of changes in the
Earth's climate, provided a deeper understanding can be achieved of the
``geomagnetic climate'' of the Sun and Earth that modulates the cosmic-ray
flux.Comment: More information and higher resolution drawings at
  http://cern.ch/Cloud Improved figure qualit It is found that the ideal magnetohydrodynamic equilibrium of an axisymmetric
gravitating magnetically confined plasma with incompressible flows is governed
by a second-order elliptic differential equation for the poloidal magnetic flux
function containing five flux functions coupled with a Poisson equation for the
gravitation potential, and an algebraic relation for the pressure. This set of
equations is amenable to analytic solutions. As an application, the
magnetic-dipole static axisymmetric equilibria with vanishing poloidal plasma
currents derived recently by Krasheninnikov, Catto, and Hazeltine [Phys. Rev.
Lett. {\bf 82}, 2689 (1999)] are extended to plasmas with finite poloidal
currents, subject to gravitating forces from a massive body (a star or black
hole) and inertial forces due to incompressible sheared flows. Explicit
solutions are obtained in two regimes: (a) in the low-energy regime
$\beta_0\approx \gamma_0\approx \delta_0 \approx\epsilon_0\ll 1$, where
$\beta_0$, $\gamma_0$, $\delta_0$, and $\epsilon_0$ are related to the thermal,
poloidal-current, flow and gravitating energies normalized to the
poloidal-magnetic-field energy, respectively, and (b) in the high-energy regime
$\beta_0\approx \gamma_0\approx \delta_0 \approx\epsilon_0\gg 1$. It turns out
that in the high-energy regime all four forces, pressure-gradient,
toroidal-magnetic-field, inertial, and gravitating contribute equally to the
formation of magnetic surfaces very extended and localized about the symmetry
plane such that the resulting equilibria resemble the accretion disks in
astrophysics.Comment: 12 pages, latex, to be published in Geophys. Astrophys. Fluid
  Dynamic MCViNE is an open source, object-oriented Monte Carlo neutron ray-tracing simulation software package. Its design allows for flexible, hierarchical representations of sophisticated instrument components such as detector systems, and samples with a variety of shapes and scattering kernels. Recently this flexible design has enabled several applications of MCViNE simulations at the Spallation Neutron Source (SNS) at Oak Ridge National Lab, including assisting design of neutron instruments at the second target station and design of novel sample environments, as well as studying effects of instrument resolution and multiple scattering. Here we provide an overview of the recent developments and new features of MCViNE since its initial introduction (Jiao et al 2016 Nucl. Instrum. Methods Phys. Res., Sect. A 810, 86–99), and some example applications Nearly fifty years after its inception, the Gravity Probe B satellite mission

  the American Physical Societ Measurements of the orientational order parameter of dissolved dichroic dyes are reported for two smectic-A liquid crystals that tilt in the presence of an in-plane electric field without any decrease in the layer spacing. The dye order parameter is determined by measuring the anisotropic absorption of linearly polarized light. Different dyes are used and measurements are also performed on a smectic liquid crystal that tilts with the expected layer contraction to check how closely the measurements reflect the order parameter of the liquid crystal. The variation of the dye order parameter with electric field is in accordance with the recently proposed model of azimuthal disorder of the tilt angle direction, but the surprising finding is that the local dye orientational order parameter is significantly lower than for the smectic liquid crystal that tilts with the expected layer contraction. This suggests that another mechanism might be contributing significantly to the smectic order, one possibility of which is the tendency for different parts of these siloxane-containing molecules to segregate within each layer. Another possible explanation is that the azimuthal disorder is due to a modulated phase with a high enough density of defects to decrease the value of the local order parameter We apply the time-dependent local density approximation (TDLDA) to calculate
dipole excitations in small carbon clusters. A strong low-frequency mode is
found which agrees well with observation for clusters C_n with n in the range
7-15. The size dependence of the mode may be understood simply as the classical
resonance of electrons in a conducting needle. For a ring geometry, the lowest
collective mode occurs at about twice the frequency of the collective mode in
the linear chain, and this may also be understood in simple terms.Comment: 19 pages, Latex(Revtex), and 7 figures Postscript; to be published in
  Zeit. Phys. D; contact is bertsch@phys.washington.ed We report the optimization of detergent-mediated reconstitution of an integral membrane-bound protein, full-length influenza M2 protein, by direct insertion into detergent-saturated liposomes. Detergent-mediated reconstitution is an important method for preparing proteoliposomes for studying membrane proteins, and must be optimized for each combination of protein and membrane constituents used. The purpose of the reconstitution was to prepare samples for site-directed spin-labeling electron paramagnetic resonance (SDSL-EPR) studies. Our goals in optimizing the protocol were to minimize the amount of detergent used, reduce overall proteoliposome preparation time, and confirm the removal of all detergent. The liposomes were comprised of (1-palmitoyl-2-oleyl-sn-glycero-phosphocholine (POPC) and 1-palmitoyl-2-oleyl-sn-glycero-3-[phospho-rac-(1-glycerol)] (POPG), and the detergent octylglucoside (OG) was used for reconstitution. Rigorous physical characterization was applied to optimize each step of the reconstitution process. We used dynamic light scattering (DLS) to determine the amount of OG needed to saturate the preformed liposomes. During detergent removal by absorption with Bio-Beads, we quantified the detergent concentration by means of a colorimetric assay, thereby determining the number of Bio-Bead additions needed to remove all detergent from the final proteoliposomes. We found that the overnight Bio-Bead incubation used in previously published protocols can be omitted, reducing the time needed for reconstitution. We also monitored the size distribution of the proteoliposomes with DLS, confirming that the size distribution remains essentially constant throughout the reconstitution process The possibility to observe the medium-modified fragmentation of hard b-quarks
tagged by a leading muon in ultrarelativistic heavy ion collisions is analyzed.
We have found that reasonable statistics, ~20000 events per 1 month of LHC run

kinematic cuts. The numerical estimates on the effect of the medium-induced

level, and instead find that the data are well described (p_null = 99.3%) by a
period increasing linearly at a rate of 77 ms per year. This corresponds to a
characteristic spin-down time of 1.34 Myr, in good agreement with theoretical
predictions based on magnetohydrodynamical simulations of angular momentum loss
from magnetic massive stars. We therefore conclude that the observations are
consistent with Sigma Ori E undergoing rotational braking due to its magnetized
line-driven wind.Comment: 6 pages, 3 figures, accepted by ApJ Letters, typos correcte Modifications to the classic time-delay effect and Doppler shift in General
Relativity (GR) are studied in the context of the Lorentz-violating
Standard-Model Extension (SME). We derive the leading Lorentz-violating
corrections to the time-delay and Doppler shift signals, for a light ray
passing near a massive body. It is demonstrated that anisotropic coefficients
for Lorentz violation control a time-dependent behavior of these signals that
is qualitatively different from the conventional case in GR. Estimates of
sensitivities to gravity-sector coefficients in the SME are given for current
and future experiments, including the recent Cassini solar conjunction
experiment.Comment: 13 pages, 4 figures, references added, matches PRD versio The status of precision electroweak measurements as of summer 2002 is
reviewed. The recent results on the anomalous magnetic moment of the muon and
on neutrino-nucleon scattering are discussed. Precision results on the
electroweak interaction obtained by the experiments at the SLC, LEP and
TEVATRON colliders are presented. The experimental results are compared with
the predictions of the minimal Standard Model and are used to constrain its
parameters, including the mass of the Higgs boson. The final LEP results on the
direct search for the Higgs boson of the Standard Model are presented.Comment: Plenary talk presented at the 31st ICHEP, Amsterdam, The Netherlands,
  July 24-31, 200 We report the detection of a strong, organized magnetic field in the secondary component of the massive O8III/I+O7.5V/III double-lined spectroscopic binary system HD 47129 (Plaskett\u27s star) in the context of the Magnetism in Massive Stars survey. Eight independent Stokes V observations were acquired using the Echelle SpectroPolarimetric Device for the Observations of Stars (ESPaDOnS) spectropolarimeter at the Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope and the Narval spectropolarimeter at the Telescope Bernard Lyot. Using least-squares deconvolution we obtain definite detections of signal in Stokes V in three observations. No significant signal is detected in the diagnostic null (N) spectra. The Zeeman signatures are broad and track the radial velocity of the secondary component; we therefore conclude that the rapidly rotating secondary component is the magnetized star. Correcting the polarized spectra for the line and continuum of the (sharp-lined) primary, we measured the longitudinal magnetic field from each observation. The longitudinal field of the secondary is variable and exhibits extreme values of -810 +/- 150 and +680 +/- 190 G, implying a minimum surface dipole polar strength of 2850 +/- 500 G. In contrast, we derive an upper limit (3 sigma) to the primary\u27s surface magnetic field of 230 G. The combination of a strong magnetic field and rapid rotation leads us to conclude that the secondary hosts a centrifugal magnetosphere fed through a magnetically confined wind. We revisit the properties of the optical line profiles and X-ray emission - previously interpreted as a consequence of colliding stellar winds - in this context. We conclude that HD 47129 represents a heretofore unique stellar system - a close, massive binary with a rapidly rotating, magnetized component - that will be a rich target for further study We construct realistic sensitivity curves for pulsar timing array searches for gravitational waves, incorporating both red and white noise contributions to individual pulsar noise spectra, and the effect of fitting to a pulsar timing model. We demonstrate the method on both simulated pulsars and a realistic array consisting of a subset of NANOGrav pulsars used in recent analyses. A comparison between the results presented here and measured upper limit curves from actual analyses shows agreement to tens of percent. The resulting sensitivity curves can be used to assess the detectability of predicted gravitational-wave signals in the nanohertz frequency band in a coherent, flexible, and computationally efficient manner The nature of magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) turbulence is analyzed through both temporal and spatial magnetic fluctuation spectra. A magnetically turbulent plasma is produced in the MHD wind tunnel configuration of the Swarthmore Spheromak Experiment. The power of magnetic fluctuations is projected into directions perpendicular and parallel to a local mean field; the ratio of these quantities shows the presence of variance anisotropy which varies as a function of frequency. Comparisons among magnetic, velocity, and density spectra are also made, demonstrating that the energy of the turbulence observed is primarily seeded by magnetic fields created during plasma production. Direct spatial spectra are constructed using multi-channel diagnostics and are used to compare to frequency spectra converted to spatial scales using the Taylor hypothesis. Evidence for the observation of dissipation due to ion inertial length scale physics is also discussed, as well as the role laboratory experiments can play in understanding turbulence typically studied in space settings such as the solar wind. Finally, all turbulence results are shown to compare fairly well to a Hall-MHD simulation of the experiment We present the steps to forecast the sensitivity of the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA) to both a stochastic gravitational wave background and deterministic wave sources. We show how to use these expressions to estimate the precision with which LISA can determine parameters associated with these sources. Tools are included to enable easy calculation of the signal-to-noise ratio and draw sensitivity curves. Benchmark values are given for easy comparison and checking of methods in the case of three worked examples. The first benchmark is the threshold stochastic gravitational wave background ΩGWh2 that LISA can observe. The second is the signal-to-noise ratio that LISA would observe for a binary black hole system identical to GW150914, radiating four years before merger. The third is the case of a monotone source, such as a binary that is far from merger A primordial spectrum of gravitational waves serves as a backlight to the
relativistic degrees of freedom of the cosmological fluid. Any change in the
particle physics content, due to a change of phase or freeze-out of a species,
will leave a characteristic imprint on an otherwise featureless primordial
spectrum of gravitational waves and indicate its early-Universe provenance. We
show that a gravitational wave detector such as the Laser Interferometer Space
Antenna would be sensitive to physics near 100 TeV in the presence of a
sufficiently strong primordial spectrum. Such a detection could complement
searches at newly proposed 100 km circumference accelerators such as the Future
Circular Collider at CERN and the Super Proton-Proton Collider in China,
thereby providing insight into a host of beyond Standard Model issues,
including the hierarchy problem, dark matter, and baryogenesis.Comment: 7 pages, 3 figures; added reference We investigate the miscible Rayleigh-Taylor (RT) instability in both 2 and 3
dimensions using direct numerical simulations, where the working fluid is
assumed incompressible under the Boussinesq approximation. We first consider
the case of randomly perturbed interfaces. With a variety of diagnostics, we
develop a physical picture for the detailed temporal development of the mixed
layer: We identify three distinct evolutionary phases in the development of the
mixed layer, which can be related to detailed variations in the growth of the
mixing zone. Our analysis provides an explanation for the observed differences
between two and three-dimensional RT instability; the analysis also leads us to
concentrate on the RT models which (1) work equally well for both laminar and
turbulent flows, and (2) do not depend on turbulent scaling within the mixing
layer between fluids. These candidate RT models are based on point sources
within bubbles (or plumes) and interaction with each other (or the background
flow). With this motivation, we examine the evolution of single plumes, and
relate our numerical results (of single plumes) to a simple analytical model
for plume evolution.Comment: 31 pages, 27 figures, to appear in November issue of JFM, 2001. For
  better figures: http://astro.uchicago.edu/~young/ps/jfmtry08.ps. The reaction ²(γ,p)n has been studied using a monochromatic and polarized gamma ray beam at energies E(γ)=19.8, 29.0, 38.6, and 60.8 MeV. The beam of an intensity ∼4×10⁵ γ/sec was obtained by Compton back scattering of mode-locked laser light off electron bunches in the Adone storage ring. Photoneutron yields were measured at nine neutron angles thetan≃15, 30, 45, 60, 90, 120, 135, 150, and 165 deg in the center of mass (c.m.) for E(γ)=19.8, 29.0, and 38.6 MeV, and at thetan≃30, 60, 90, 120, and 150 deg c.m. for E(γ)=60.8 MeV. The polarization independent component Iₒ(theta) of the differential cross section and the polarization dependent component PI₁(theta) were deduced and the angular distribution of the azimuthal asymmetry factor Σ(theta)=I₁(theta)/Iₒ(theta) was obtained. An extensive comparison with theory has been carried out and the inclusion of corrections due to meson exchange currents and to Δ-isobar configurations have been shown to be mandatory at energies E(γ)≳40 MeV. Theoretical and experimental implications of intermediate energy deuteron photo- disintegration studies are discussed in some detail We demonstrate a way to circumvent the interruption of evaporative cooling
observed at high bias field for $^{87}$Rb atoms trapped in the (F=2, m=+2)
ground state. Our scheme uses a 3-frequencies-RF-knife achieved by mixing two
RF frequencies. This compensates part of the non linearity of the Zeeman
effect, allowing us to achieve BEC where standard 1-frequency-RF-knife
evaporation method did not work. We are able to get efficient evaporative
cooling, provided that the residual detuning between the transition and the RF
frequencies in our scheme is smaller than the power broadening of the RF
transitions at the end of the evaporation ramp.Comment: 12 pages, 2 figure A novel method for calculating resonances in three-body Coulombic systems is
proposed. The Faddeev-Merkuriev integral equations are solved by applying the
Coulomb-Sturmian separable expansion method. The $e^- e^+ e^-$ S-state
resonances up to $n=5$ threshold are calculated.Comment: 6 pages, 2 ps figure The classical experiments on turbulent friction in rough pipes were performed
by J. Nikuradse in the 1930's. Seventy years later, they continue to defy
theory. Here we model Nikuradse's experiments using the phenomenological theory
of Kolmog\'orov, a theory that is widely thought to be applicable only to
highly idealized flows. Our results include both the empirical scalings of
Blasius and Strickler, and are otherwise in minute qualitative agreement with
the experiments; they suggest that the phenomenological theory may be relevant
to other flows of practical interest; and they unveil the existence of close
ties between two milestones of experimental and theoretical turbulence.Comment: Accepted for publication in PRL; 4 pages, 4 figures; revised versio The mathematical model of J. Keller for predicting World Record race times,
based on a simple differential equation of motion, predicted quite well the
records of the day. One of its shortcoming is that it neglects to account for a
sprinter's energy loss around a curve, a most important consideration
particularly in the 200m--400m. An extension to Keller's work is considered,
modeling the aforementioned energy loss as a simple function of the centrifugal
force acting on the runner around the curve. Theoretical World Record
performances for indoor and outdoor 200m are discussed, and the use of the
model at 300m is investigated. Some predictions are made for possible 200m
outdoor and indoor times as run by Canadian 100m WR holder Donovan Bailey,
based on his 100m final performance at the 1996 Olympic Games in Atlanta.Comment: 20pp, latex; submitted to the ""Canadian Journal of Physics We report the discovery that the star V474 Car is an extremely active, high
velocity halo RS CVn system. The star was originally identified as a possible
pre-main sequence star in Carina, given its enhanced stellar activity, rapid
rotation (10.3 days), enhanced Li, and absolute magnitude that places it above
the main sequence. However, its extreme radial velocity (264 km s$^{-1}$)
suggested that this system was unlike any previously known pre-MS system. Our
detailed spectroscopic analysis of echelle spectra taken with the CTIO 4-m
finds that V474 Car is both a spectroscopic binary with orbital period similar
to the photometric rotation period, and metal poor ([Fe/H] $\simeq -$0.99). The
star's Galactic orbit is extremely eccentric (e $\simeq$ 0.93) with
perigalacticon of only $\sim$0.3 kpc of the Galactic center - and its
eccentricity and smallness of its perigalacticon are only surpassed by
$\sim$0.05%, of local F/G-type field stars. The observed characteristics are
consistent with V474 Car being a high velocity, metal poor, tidally-locked
chromospherically active binary (CAB), i.e.\ a halo RS CVn binary, and one of
only a few such specimens known.Comment: Accepted to Astronomical Journa These lectures aim at providing a pedagogical overview of neutrino physics.
We will mostly deal with standard neutrinos, the ones that are part of the
Standard Model of particle physics, and with their standard dynamics, which is
enough to understand in a coherent picture most of the rich data available.
After introducing the basic theoretical framework, we will illustrate the
experimental determination of the neutrino parameters and their theoretical
implications, in particular for the origin of neutrino masses.Comment: 30 pages, contribution to the 2010 European School of High-Energy
  Physics; 20 June - 3 July 2010, Raseborg, Finlan We review recent experimental and theoretical progress in spin physics, as
presented in the spin parallel session of DIS2006. In particular, we discuss
the status of the nucleon spin structure, transverse polarized asymmetries, and
recent developments such as DVCS, polarized fragmentation and polarized
resummation.Comment: 14 pages, 10 figures, latex with ws-procs9x6.cls (included),
  convenors' summary of the spin working group at DIS2006 (Tsukuba, Japan In response to increasing calls for the reform of the undergraduate science
curriculum for life science majors and pre-medical students (Bio2010,
Scientific Foundations for Future Physicians, Vision & Change), an
interdisciplinary team has created NEXUS/Physics: a repurposing of an
introductory physics curriculum for the life sciences. The curriculum interacts
strongly and supportively with introductory biology and chemistry courses taken
by life sciences students, with the goal of helping students build general,
multi-discipline scientific competencies. In order to do this, our two-semester
NEXUS/Physics course sequence is positioned as a second year course so students
will have had some exposure to basic concepts in biology and chemistry.
NEXUS/Physics stresses interdisciplinary examples and the content differs
markedly from traditional introductory physics to facilitate this. It extends
the discussion of energy to include interatomic potentials and chemical
reactions, the discussion of thermodynamics to include enthalpy and Gibbs free
energy, and includes a serious discussion of random vs. coherent motion
including diffusion. The development of instructional materials is coordinated
with careful education research. Both the new content and the results of the
research are described in a series of papers for which this paper serves as an
overview and context.Comment: 12 page A stored-muon-beam neutrino factory may require transverse ionization cooling
of the muon beam. We describe recent progress in research and development on
energy absorbers for muon-beam cooling carried out by a collaboration of
university and laboratory groups.Comment: 7 pages, 1 figure, presented at the 3rd International Workshop on
  Neutrino Factory Based on Muon Storage Rings (NuFACT'01), May 24-30, 2001,
  Tsukuba, Japa The Rayleigh-Taylor instability of a magnetic fluid superimposed on a
non-magnetic liquid of lower density may be suppressed with the help of a
spatially homogeneous magnetic field rotating in the plane of the undisturbed
interface. Starting from the complete set of Navier-Stokes equations for both
liquids a Floquet analysis is performed which consistently takes into account
the viscosities of the fluids. Using experimentally relevant values of the
parameters we suggest to use this stabilization mechanism to provide controlled
initial conditions for an experimental investigation of the Rayleigh-Taylor
instability Polymerization of microtubules is ubiquitous in biological cells and under
certain conditions it becomes oscillatory in time. Here simple reaction models
are analyzed that capture such oscillations as well as the length distribution
of microtubules. We assume reaction conditions that are stationary over many
oscillation periods, and it is a Hopf bifurcation that leads to a persistent
oscillatory microtubule polymerization in these models. Analytical expressions
are derived for the threshold of the bifurcation and the oscillation frequency
in terms of reaction rates as well as typical trends of their parameter
dependence are presented. Both, a catastrophe rate that depends on the density
of {\it guanosine triphosphate} (GTP) liganded tubulin dimers and a delay
reaction, such as the depolymerization of shrinking microtubules or the decay
of oligomers, support oscillations. For a tubulin dimer concentration below the
threshold oscillatory microtubule polymerization occurs transiently on the
route to a stationary state, as shown by numerical solutions of the model
equations. Close to threshold a so--called amplitude equation is derived and it
is shown that the bifurcation to microtubule oscillations is supercritical.Comment: 21 pages and 12 figure The vast majority of sampling systems operate in a standard way: at each tick
of a fixed-frequency master clock a digitizer reads out a voltage that
corresponds to the value of some physical quantity and translates it into a bit
pattern that is either transmitted, stored, or processed right away. Thus
signal sampling at evenly spaced time intervals is the rule: however this is
not always the case, and uneven sampling is sometimes unavoidable.
  While periodic or quasi-periodic uneven sampling of a deterministic signal
can reasonably be expected to produce artifacts, it is much less obvious that
the same happens with noise: here I show that this is indeed the case only for
long-memory noise processes, i.e., power-law noises $1/f^\alpha$ with $\alpha >
2$. The resulting artifacts are usually a nuisance although they can be
eliminated with a proper processing of the signal samples, but they could also
be turned to advantage and used to encode information.Comment: 5 figure We propose a classical solution for the kinetic description of matter falling
into a black hole, which permits to evaluate both the kinetic entropy and the
entropy production rate of classical infalling matter at the event horizon. The
formulation is based on a relativistic kinetic description for classical
particles in the presence of an event horizon. An H-theorem is established
which holds for arbitrary models of black holes and is valid also in the
presence of contracting event horizons The physical origins of negative refractive index are derived from a dilute
microscopic model, producing a result that is generalized to the dense
condensed phase limit. In particular, scattering from a thin sheet of electric
and magnetic dipoles driven above resonance is used to form a fundamental
description for negative refraction. Of practical significance, loss and
dispersion are implicit in the microscopic model. While naturally occurring
negative index materials are unavailable, ferromagnetic and ferroelectric
materials provide device design opportunities.Comment: 4 pages, 1 figur I show how to construct Monte Carlo algorithms (programs), prove that they
are correct and document them. Complicated algorithms are build using a handful
of elementary methods. This construction process is transparently illustrated
using graphical representation in which complicated graphs consist of only
several elementary building blocks. In particular I discuss the equivalent
algorithms, that is different MC algorithms, with different arrangements of the
elementary building blocks, which generate the same final probability
distribution. I also show how to transform a given MC algorithm into another
equivalent one and discuss advantages of the various ``architectures'' Using a bit-string model similar to biological simulations, the competition
between different languages is simulated both without and with spatial
structure. We compare our agent-based work with differential equations and the
competing bit-string model of Kosmidis et al.Comment: 8th Granada Seminar (sociophysics); for AIP Conf. Proc. (8 pages

44a61d9a-fe20-4fd6-bb53-91e89b722e0c	pelagic	"Fish stomachs from 18 demersal and pelagic fishes from the coast of Terengganu in Malaysia were examined. The components of the fishes’ diets varied in number, weight, and their frequency of occurrence. The major food items in the stomachs of each species were determined using an Index of Relative Importance. A conceptual food web structure indicates that fish species in the study area can be classified into three predatory groups: (1) predators on largely planktivorous or pelagic species; (2) predators on largely benthophagous or demersal species; and (3) mixed feeders that consume both pelagic and demersal species The consumption of fish in Croatia is relatively low for a Mediterranean country. One of the main reasons for this is the inadequate supply of fish. The supply of fish is usually limited to expensive species of whitefish, while the supply of pelagic fish is very scarce. Pelagic fish can rarely be found in restaurants, and in the fish- markets it reaches very high prices. The basic goal of the project ""Srdela Snack"" (srdela - Croatian word for sardine) was to set up and test a new model of commercialization of pelagic fish through franchise ""fast - food"" outlets. In the paper we will describe the concept of this new model which includes the whole distribution channel, from fishermen, through processors, restaurants to consumers. In this model fishermen supply fresh pelagic fish to approved restaurant s (members of the franchise) which prepare the fish according to traditional recipes. In this way a completely new product is introduced in the Croatian market. The main idea was to offer a high- quality, simple and convenient meals made of pelagic fish from the Croatian Adriatic. This model of commercialization of pelagic fish was tested through a pilot project. In the pilot project the standards of food quality were determined, the traditional recipes for preparing the food were selected, and the menu, consisting entirely of pelagic fish dishes was made. Finally, the logo of the franchise restaurant was designed. The test restaurant was opened in the summer 2004. The visitors of the restaurant participated in a survey which was used to determine the degree of their satisfaction with the new product and the new model of pelagic fish commercialization. The results of the survey showed that there is a strong demand for pelagic fish in the Croatian market. Most of the interviewed consumers liked the new product; they consider it very healthy, affordable, tasty, and typical for Mediterranean and Croatia. Fishermen and restaurant - owners also showed a great interest for this new model of commercialization because it could provide them with a bigger income. Since the results of the pilot project showed that this kind of innovation in the distribution channel is very successful, this model of franchise restaurants offering pelagic fish ""fast - food"" can be implemented on the national level.Innovation, Commercialization, Pelagic fish, Franchise, Agribusiness, Plastic waste has been documented in nearly all types of marine environments and has been found in species spanning all levels of marine food webs. Within these marine environments, deep pelagic waters encompass the largest ecosystems on Earth. We lack a comprehensive understanding of the concentrations, cycling, and fate of plastic waste in sub-surface waters, constraining our ability to implement effective, large-scale policy and conservation strategies. We used remotely operated vehicles and engineered purpose-built samplers to collect and examine the distribution of microplastics in the Monterey Bay pelagic ecosystem at water column depths ranging from 5 to 1000 m. Laser Raman spectroscopy was used to identify microplastic particles collected from throughout the deep pelagic water column, with the highest concentrations present at depths between 200 and 600 m. Examination of two abundant particle feeders in this ecosystem, pelagic red crabs (Pleuroncodes planipes) and giant larvaceans (Bathochordaeus stygius), showed that microplastic particles readily flow from the environment into coupled water column and seafloor food webs. Our findings suggest that one of the largest and currently underappreciated reservoirs of marine microplastics may be contained within the water column and animal communities of the deep sea Little information exists on the status of pelagic shark populations in the Atlantic Ocean, especially in the Gulf of Mexico and Caribbean Sea. We derived indices of relative abundance for pelagic sharks based on mandatory logbooks and observer reports from a scientific observer program of the United States (US) pelagic longline fleet. Time series data from the pelagic longline logbook program (1986-2005) and the pelagic longline observer program (1992-2005) were standardized with Generalized Linear Model (GLM) procedures. Declines in relative abundance for the 6 pelagic shark species or genera examined in the logbook data analysis ranged from 43% for mako sharks, Isurus spp., to 88% for blue sharks, Prionace glauca, whereas declines in relative abundance obtained from the observer data analysis were less accentuated than those in the logbook data analysis, with the trend being positive for night sharks, Carcharhinus signatus, and thresher sharks, Alopias spp. There was no significant change in the fork length at capture over the time period considered for blue sharks, shortfin makos Isurus oxyrinchus, or night sharks. The trends obtained must be viewed cautiously given recognized shortcomings, especially of the logbook dataset, and the highly migratory nature of pelagic sharks, which requires a more comprehensive evaluation of trends throughout their range In this study we investigate small scale distribution of pelagic fish within a windfarm by means of a high resolution sonar (DIDSON, Dual frequency IDentification SONar; Soundmetrics). In addition we assess the bias of small scale variations induced by the effects of wind turbines (monopiles) on distribution of the pelagic fish community in the hydro acoustic surveys carried out on the OWEZ Near Shore Wind farm (NSW) Apart from activities of some foreign-based vessels, commercial exploitation of pelagic fishery resources in Nigeria has been limited to inland and inshore waters. Estimated potential for the inshore pelagic fishery is 70,000-90,000 tonnes while the small pelagic resources in the near offshore as well as tuna and tuna-like fishes further offshore have potentials of about 10,000 metric tonnes each. Despite the abundance of tuna within and adjoining the Nigerian EEZ, and its importance in the international market, only foreign-flagged vessels take advantage. In addition, the inshore pelagic fisheries in Nigeria have for long remained underexploited. The most common processing method has remained the age-old traditional smoke-drying, which is inadequate resulting in colossal waste through denaturation and incessant infestations by insects and moulds among other causes. The use of modern smoking techniques coupled with effective distribution systems can undoubtedly reduce waste. However, these are often not within the reach of most artisanal processors. It is proposed that the organised private sector should invest on simple but proven processing equipment such as smoking kilns. The inshore pelagic fish species and other small fishes can sustain cottage canning industries sited in fishing villages/settlements while larger canning factories should be based on offshore resources. Modalities for successful investments are highlighted, while a major consideration is given to joint venture"	['4635068', '2957892', '85860378', '7181813', '17479138', '4632350']	[[{'name': 'Bachok, Z.'}, {'name': 'Mansor, M.I.'}, {'name': 'Noordin, R.M.'}], [{'name': 'Kolega, Ante'}, {'name': 'Markovina, Jerko'}, {'name': 'Radman, Marija'}], [{'name': 'Choy, C Anela'}, {'name': 'Erwin, Benjamin'}, {'name': 'Firl, Evan'}, {'name': 'Gagne, Tyler O'}, {'name': 'Halden, Rolf U'}, {'name': 'Hamilton, J Andrew'}, {'name': 'Katija, Kakani'}, {'name': 'Lisin, Susan E'}, {'name': 'Robison, Bruce H'}, {'name': 'Rolsky, Charles'}, {'name': 'S Van Houtan, Kyle'}], [{'name': 'Beerhircher, L.R.'}, {'name': 'Brown, C.A.'}, {'name': 'Cortés, Enric'}], [{'name': 'Burggraaf, D.'}, {'name': 'Couperus, A.S.'}, {'name': 'Keeken, O.A., van'}, {'name': 'Kooten, T., van'}, {'name': 'Tribuhl, S.V.'}, {'name': 'Winter, H.V.'}], [{'name': 'Marcus, O.'}]]	"['Diet composition and food habits of demersal and pelagic marine fishes from Terengganu waters, east coast of Peninsular Malaysia', 'Innovation in commercialization of pelagic fish: the example of ""Srdela Snack"" Franchise', 'The vertical distribution and biological transport of marine microplastics across the epipelagic and mesopelagic water column.', 'Relative abundance of pelagic sharks in the western North Atlantic Ocean, including the Gulf of Mexico and Caribbean Sea', 'Use of high resolution sonar for near-turbine fish observations (DIDSON) - We@Sea 2007-002', 'Present status and potentials of inshore and offshore pelagic fisheries in the capture and processing industries of Nigeria']"	6.0	exploratory	0.5
953f0bb2-7ef3-4bd7-9143-0dce21285d94	ai ethics	"Artificial intelligence (AI)-based technology has achieved many great things, such as facial recognition, medical diagnosis, and self-driving cars. AI promises enormous benefits for economic growth, social development, as well as human well-being and safety improvement. However, the low-level of explainability, data biases, data security, data privacy, and ethical problems of AI-based technology pose significant risks for users, developers, humanity, and societies. As AI advances, one critical issue is how to address the ethical and moral challenges associated with AI. Even though the concept of “machine ethics” was proposed around 2006, AI ethics is still in the infancy stage. AI ethics is the field related to the study of ethical issues in AI. To address AI ethics, one needs to consider the ethics of AI and how to build ethical AI. Ethics of AI studies the ethical principles, rules, guidelines, policies, and regulations that are related to AI. Ethical AI is an AI that performs and behaves ethically. One must recognize and understand the potential ethical and moral issues that may be caused by AI to formulate the necessary ethical principles, rules, guidelines, policies, and regulations for AI (i.e., Ethics of AI). With the appropriate ethics of AI, one can then build AI that exhibits ethical behavior (i.e., Ethical AI). This paper will discuss AI ethics by looking at the ethics of AI and ethical AI. What are the perceived ethical and moral issues with AI? What are the general and common ethical principles, rules, guidelines, policies, and regulations that can resolve or at least attenuate these ethical and moral issues with AI? What are some of the necessary features and characteristics of an ethical AI? How to adhere to the ethics of AI to build ethical AI Artificial intelligence (AI) ethics is a field that has emerged as a response to the growing concern regarding the impact of AI. It can be read as a nascent field and as a subset of the wider field of digital ethics, which addresses concerns raised by the development and deployment of new digital technologies, such as AI, big data analytics, and blockchain technologies. The principle aim of this article is to provide a high-level conceptual discussion of the field by way of introducing basic concepts and sketching approaches and central themes in AI ethics. The first part introduces concepts by noting what is being referred to by “AI” and “ethics”, etc.; the second part explores some predecessors to AI ethics, namely engineering ethics, philosophy of technology, and science and technology studies; the third part discusses three current approaches to AI ethics namely, principles, processes, and ethical consciousness; and finally, the fourth part discusses central themes in translating ethics in to engineering practice. We conclude by summarizing and noting the inherent interdisciplinary future directions and debates in AI ethics In this paper we present a set of key demarcations, particularly important
when discussing ethical and societal issues of current AI research and
applications. Properly distinguishing issues and concerns related to Artificial
General Intelligence and weak AI, between symbolic and connectionist AI, AI
methods, data and applications are prerequisites for an informed debate. Such
demarcations would not only facilitate much-needed discussions on ethics on
current AI technologies and research. In addition sufficiently establishing
such demarcations would also enhance knowledge-sharing and support rigor in
interdisciplinary research between technical and social sciences.Comment: Proceedings of the Norwegian AI Symposium 2019 (NAIS 2019),
  Trondheim, Norwa Philosophical research in AI has hitherto largely focused on the ethics of
AI. In this paper we, an ethicist of belief and a machine learning scientist,
suggest that we need to pursue a novel area of philosophical research in AI -
the epistemology of AI, and in particular an ethics of belief for AI, i.e., an
ethics of AI belief. Here we take the ethics of belief, a field that has been
defined in various ways, to refer to a sub-field within epistemology. This
subfield is concerned with the study of possible moral, practical, and other
non-alethic dimensions of belief. And in this paper, we will primarily be
concerned with the normative question within the ethics of belief of what
agents - both human and artificial - ought to believe, rather than with
descriptive questions concerning whether certain beliefs meet various
evaluative standards such as being true, being justified or warranted,
constituting knowledge, and so on. We suggest four topics in extant work in the
ethics of (human) belief that can be applied to an ethics of AI belief:
doxastic wronging by AI; morally owed beliefs; pragmatic and moral encroachment
on AI beliefs; and moral responsibility for AI beliefs. We also indicate an
important nascent area of philosophical research in epistemic injustice and AI
that has not yet been recognized as research in the ethics of AI belief, but
which is so in virtue of concerning moral and practical dimensions of belief More than any other region attempting to get ahead in the global AI race, the EU has emphasized a commitment to ‘AI-ethics’ and invested significant work in the development of principles and rules for the ethical governance of AI. This paper examines the production, performance, and politics of AI-ethics in the EU through a close, co-productionist reading of how the “European Group on Ethics in Science and New Technologies” has framed AI and its desirable relationship to humans. Our analysis shows that the making of AI-ethics in this context extends far beyond the settlement of principles and norms for AI. Instead, we argue that AI-ethics is, at the same time, performing authoritative acts of ontological classification that cut the human clean from AI to render it controllable and manageable. These ontological politics, we show, serve to embed AI within long-held imaginaries of European unification beyond market harmonization and re-configure how the EU imagines to achieve an ‘ever closer union’ among its members in the innovation era. Different to attempts at deeper integration through the mobilization of science, the turn to AI-ethics presents a novel rationale through which the EU legitimizes its authority to govern, suggesting a constitutive role for ethics in the EU’s contemporary integration efforts.&nbsp"	['129167465', '149541654', '58971485', '148051967', '157820061']	[[{'name': 'Siau, Keng'}, {'name': 'Wang, Weiyu'}], [{'name': 'Kazim, E'}, {'name': 'Koshiyama, AS'}], [{'name': 'A Etzioni'}, {'name': 'B Goodman'}, {'name': 'C Coenen'}, {'name': 'Corinne Cath'}, {'name': 'DD Luxton'}, {'name': 'DL Waltz'}, {'name': 'E Fisher'}, {'name': 'E Vayena'}, {'name': 'P Wang'}, {'name': 'R Nydal'}, {'name': 'R Pfeifer'}, {'name': 'WS McCulloch'}, {'name': 'Y Wang'}, {'name': 'Z Konkoli'}], [{'name': 'Ma, Winnie'}, {'name': 'Valton, Vincent'}], [{'name': 'Frahm, Nina'}, {'name': 'Schiølin, Kasper'}]]	['Artificial Intelligence (AI) Ethics: Ethics of AI and Ethical AI', 'A high-level overview of AI ethics', 'Ethics of Artificial Intelligence Demarcations', 'Toward an Ethics of AI Belief', 'Toward an ‘Ever Closer Union’: The Making of AI-Ethics in the EU']	5.0	exploratory	0.5
520291f8-dd22-4191-a24e-c860174d8d25	wagner anti-terrorism	The outcome of the Civil War brought freedom to over six million slaves of African descent. These Freedmen communities remained a critical source of labor for the agrarian based economy of the southern U.S. Conflicts erupted because former slaves sought to exercise their new freedoms against the restrictions placed on them by local authorities. New laws, mob actions and acts of organized white terrorism were used to subjugate free citizens and return them to their former stations of labor. Political activities and participation in the electoral process were violently discouraged. Vocal opponents of the new system were often targeted for murder along with their families. A vital component to this oppressive movement was a concerted effort among local southern governments to disarm African American citizens. Radical Republicans attempted to intercede with new laws based on 2nd amendment protections, but Northern indifference to the plight of former slaves made this politically futile. Unconstitutional firearm restrictions in the reconstruction south ensured that the subjugation of Freedmen would continue indefinitely. Without political agency, or the means of an organized community militia to generate such power, the realization of freedom and the rights of citizenship for African Americans remained unobtainable for nearly 100 years This paper seeks to analyse cultural trauma theories and their consequences as well as their potential applicability to cases of collective trauma where access to the legal arena in the rehabilitation process is not possible. When ‘state terror’ occurs, such as in Latin America, or, more arguably Italy, access to the legal arena is systematically denied through a variety of criminal strategies. In these cases, the cultural working through of trauma takes place on the aesthetic level. What are the consequences of this process both for the inscription of the crucial event in public discourse and for its relationship with justice? Moreover, how do aesthetic codes affect the public definition of justice and a collective understanding of what happened?Publisher PD New security threats have emerged as major new areas of policy development in the European Union, especially during the 'war on terror'. This paper makes two significant points that counter theoretical expectations of EU counter-terrorism. Both are derived from an analysis of empirical events of EU practice. Firstly, it argues that it is vital to analyse EU institutional actor behaviour in the process of 'constructing security threats', especially when dealing with the responses to international terrorism. Secondly, despite the importance of member states in the European Union, institutional actors such as the European Commission or the Council Secretariat are increasingly gaining in importance. The Commission can (though not always does) play a significant role in this process - the role of a supranational policy entrepreneur. Yet, it is not alone in this - the Council Secretariat can also add to the notion of policy entrepreneurship at the EU level. This argument reveals shortcomings of intergovernmental understanding of European integration in the area of counter-terrorism. The paper analyses different dimensions of EU counter-terrorism, its legal and political construction, and demonstrates the significance of supranational policy entrepreneurs in the political adoption process When you hear the word “terrorist,” who do you picture? Chances are, it is not a white person. In the United States, two common though false narratives about terrorists who attack America abound. We see them on television, in the movies, on the news, and, currently, in the Trump administration. The first is that “terrorists are always (brown) Muslims.” The second is that “white people are never terrorists.” Different strands of critical race theory can help us understand these two narratives. One strand examines the role of unconscious cognitive biases in the production of stereotypes, such as the stereotype of the “Muslim terrorist.” Another strand focuses on white privilege, such as the privilege of avoiding the terrorist label. These false narratives play a crucial role in Trump’s propaganda. As the critical race analysis uncovers, these two narratives dovetail with two constituent parts of propaganda: flawed ideologies and aspirational myths. Propaganda relies on preexisting false ideologies, which is another way to describe racist stereotyping. Propaganda also relies on certain ideals and myths, in this case, the myth of white innocence and white superiority. Thus, the Trump administration’s intentional invocation of both narratives amounts to propaganda in more than just the colloquial sense. Part I illustrates each of the two narratives. Part II then analyzes them through a critical race lens, showing how they map onto two strands of critical race theory. Next, Part III examines how these narratives simultaneously enable and constitute propaganda. Finally, Part IV argues that the propagation of these false narratives hurts the nation’s security The passage of the Wagner (National Labor Relations) Act of 1935 represented an unprecedented effort to guarantee American workers basic labor rights--the rights to organize unions, to provoke meaningful collective bargaining, and to strike. Previous attempts by workers and government administrators to realize these rights in the workplace met with extraordinary, often violent, resistance from powerful industrial employers, whose repressive measures were described by government officials as a system of  industrial terrorism.  Although labor scholars have acknowledged these practices and paid some attention to the way they initially frustrated labor rights and influenced the jurisprudence and politics of labor relations in the late 1930s and early 1940s, the literature has neither adequately described the extent and intensity of this phenomenon nor fully explored its effects. This Article remedies that shortcoming. Focusing on three industries where the practice of industrial terrorism was especially well developed and its influence especially pronounced, this Article shows how the practitioners of industrial terrorism and their allies in Congress were able to turn the legacy of violence and disorder, which they authored by their violent resistance to the Wagner Act, into the basis of an extraordinary counterattack on labor rights. It shows how this attack culminated in 1947 with the enactment of the profoundly reactionary Taft-Hartley Act and remade the landscape of American labor relations @ 2012 by the Regents of the University of California. All rights reserved.The article analyzes prohibitions on membership in terrorist organizations and examines their justifiability. It begins by providing a definition of a terrorist organization. It then describes the far-reaching modern prohibitions on membership in terrorist organizations in various jurisdictions. The article goes on to provide a doctrinal analysis of membership offenses. Based on similarities with conspiracy doctrine, membership offenses are analyzed as expansions of attempt law or, in some cases, of complicity doctrines. The justfiability of this expansion is examined. The article introduces a distinction between exclusively terrorist organizations, passive membership of which can be legitimately prohibited under certain conditions, and ancillary and dual-purpose organizations, passive membership of which cannot be legitimately prohibited. Next, the justiflability ofprohibiting more active forms of membership in each of these types of organizations is discussed. Last, guidelines for the legislation of appropriate prohibitions are proposed Both crime and terrorism impose costs onto society through the channels of fear and worry. Identifying and targeting groups which are especially affected by worries might be one way to reduce the total costs of these two types of insecurity. However, compared to the drivers of the fear of crime, the determinants of concerns regarding global terrorism are less well known. Using nationally representative survey data, we analyse and compare the individual determinants of concern about global terrorism and crime, and show that worries about terrorism are driven by similar determinants as those about crime, which could have important policy implications. We furthermore provide an insight into the structure of the determinants of concerns regarding other public and private goods.Terrorism, crime, fear, attitudes, GSOEP	['48200707', '42933018', '18674777', '537817', '46677324', '4523902', '7131235', '2500721']	[[{'name': 'Schenk, David H.'}], [{'name': 'Haesebrouck, Tim'}], [{'name': 'Tota, Anna Lisa'}], [{'name': 'Kaunert, C'}], [{'name': 'Corbin, Caroline Mala'}], [{'name': 'White, Ahmed A'}], [{'name': 'Levanon, L'}], [{'name': 'Cathérine Müller'}, {'name': 'Tilman Brück'}]]	['Freedmen with Firearms: White Terrorism and Black Disarmament During Reconstruction', 'Democratic participation in the air strikes against Islamic state : a qualitative comparative analysis', 'How to transform a ‘place of violence’ into a ‘space of collective remembering’: Italy and its traumatic past', 'Towards supranational governance in EU counter-terrorism? - The role of the Commission and the Council Secretariat', 'Terrorists Are Always Muslim but Never White: At the Intersection of Critical Race Theory and Propaganda', 'Industrial Terrorism and the Unmaking of New Deal Labor Law', 'Criminal prohibitions on membership in terrorist organizations', 'Comparing the Determinants of Concern about Terrorism and Crime']	8.0	exploratory	0.5

This is often ignored in methane flux inversions, and the impacts of neglecting interactive chemistry have not been quantified. Using a coupled‐chemistry box model, we show that neglecting the effect of methane source perturbation on [OH] can lead to a 25% bias in estimating abrupt changes in methane sources after only 10 years. Further, large CO emissions, such as from biomass burning, can increase methane concentrations by extending the methane lifetime through impacts on [OH]. Finally, we quantify the biases of including (or excluding) coupled chemistry in the context of recent methane and CO trends. Decreasing CO concentrations, beginning in the 2000's, have notable impacts on methane flux inversions. Given these nonnegligible errors, decadal methane emissions inversions should incorporate chemical feedbacks for more robust methane trend analyses and source attributions This paper discusses the research progress of low-power technology of laser methane sensors for coal mine. On the basis of environment of coal mines, such as ultra-long-distance transmission and high stability, a series of studies have been carried out. The preliminary results have been achieved in the research of low power consumption, temperature and pressure compensation and reliability design. The technology is applied to various products in coal mines, and achieves high stability and high reliability in products such as laser methane sensor, laser methane detection alarm device, wireless laser methane detection alarm device, and optic fiber multichannel laser methane sensor. Experimental testing and analysis of the characteristics of laser methane sensors, combined with the actual application With the discoveries of Bottom Simulating Reflectors (BSRs), large and dense chemosynthetic communities and rapid sulfate reductions in pore space sediments, gas hydrates may exist in offshore southwestern Taiwan. Methane concentrations in pore space sediments have been measured to investigate if fluids and gases are derived from dissociation of gas hydrates. Very high methane concentrations and very shallow depths of sulfate methane interface (SMI) imply the high methane flux underneath the seafloor. Linear sulfate gradients, low total organic carbon (TOC) have been combined to describe the process of anaerobic methane oxidation (AMO) and calculate the iffusive

methane flux in Chuang et al. (2010). However, the appearance of concave (or non-linear) profiles of sulfate in some cores might indicate advective fluid flows. Hence, the methane flux may be much greater under advective conditions. In this study, numerical transport-reaction models were applied to calculate the methane flux including diffusion and advection of dissolved sulfate and methane and the anaerobic methane oxidation of methane. According to the modeled results of three giant piston cores (MD05-2911, MD05-2912 and MD05-2913) collected during the r/v Marion Dufresne cruise in 2005, gas bubbling or bioirrigation may occur in these site. Values of the methane flux ranging from 1.91 to 5.17 mmol m-2yr-1 and upward fluid flow velocities around 0.05-0.13 cm yr-1 are related to different geologic structures in the active continental margin. Site MD05-2912 is located on the Tainan Ridge where anticlines and blind thrusts are the dominate structures. Site MD052911 is on the Yung-An Ridge characterized by emergent and imbricate thrusts"	['77567350', '8016927', '5129908']	[[{'name': 'Frankenberg, Christian'}, {'name': 'Nguyen, Newton H.'}, {'name': 'Prather, Michael J.'}, {'name': 'Turner, Alexander J.'}, {'name': 'Yin, Yi'}], [{'name': 'Grattan, K.

d636a980-15ab-4354-a008-71b4241f2ada	accounting	"In recent years, there have been many reforms in the field of accounting. In the same time, scientists
          focus on the leading methods of accounting, financial management and economic opportunities for the additional use of accounting tools to introduce reforms in the field of the accounting of public sector entities. The main goal of this paper is to reveal the leading features of the accounting system of public sector entities and to study the aspects of a new accounting system, which in the future can be implemented into the activities of public sector entities.
          The paper provides a scientific vision of the accounting reform of public sector entities. Our vision of forming a new accounting system in the public sector is based on the accounting model used in Italy and takes into account the peculiarities of the methodology and accounting organization in accordance with the International Accounting Standards. We highlight the main problems of introducing a new accounting system for public sector entities, based on the International Accounting Standards. In our opinion, this research can form new knowledge in the national literature on the accounting of public sector entities and highlight the main problems that arise while implementing accounting reforms. In addition, our research results can serve as a basis for the implementation of the accounting of public sector entities on the basis of International Accounting Standards for the public sector and the accrual principle. We believe that the main scientific aspects of public sector accounting will be the basis for future reforms based on the implementation of International Accounting Standards in the activities of public sector entities The accounting industry has experienced a substantial transformation from manual bookkeeping of ledgers and trial balances to advanced accounting software. Many accounting firms, though, use accounting software with standalone packages which do not support the web. As a result, accounting firms demanded integrated software which could manage overall business management system. Accounting firms rely on software advancements in technology and specialised accounting software that can help financial activities like accounts, administrative tasks, payroll, tax and sales systems with fewer complexities. Real time information gave rise to the demand for accounting services which have higher accessibility of cloud-based software applications. The adoption of cloud accounting applications for accounting firms at accelerating speed leads to the question of considering the impact of cloud accounting software which has effects on the operational expenses of accounting firms. This research examines what encourages small accounting firms to grasp cloud accounting. The qualitative method of collecting data of small accounting firms was done through the distribution of questionnaires that use cloud accounting software. Findings from this research were used to understand the impact of employee training and IT costs which firms face by implementing cloud based accounting. The firms in this research have majorly agreed that they experienced overall increase in their operational costs. As a result, organisational efficiency was also increased. The recommendations provided by the researchers point to a similar study to find out the impact of profitability on firms from implementing cloud software and suggest to firms how to use cloud software to expand their client base The essence of the concept “accounting policy” in its modern sense, main principles and problems of its formation are discussed in the article. The process of accounting policy implementation into
enterprise practical activity under accounting reforms conditions in Ukraine has been under consideration. Main stages of accounting policy formation have been considered. Organizational and methodical basis of accounting
policy formation at micro- and macro- levels has been highlighted. State participation in requirements setting on accounting policy content and structure, its detailed elaboration degree, area of usage, accounting policy focus
on different groups of accounting information users has been specified. Statutory regulations and legislative instruments of accounting policy formation have been explained, its place in enterprise management system has
been studied. Ways of improvement of Order of enterprise accounting policy taking into account accounting issues have been determined. Directions of further research have been proposed The Central and Eastern European Countries (CEEC) acknowledge foreign direct investment (FDI) as an essential tool in the development and modernization of their economies. The first part of this paper centers on economic stability and FDI inflows in the CEE indicating the Polish leadership in inward FDI inflow. The section of this study focuses on Poland and provides a description of business environment and current FDI trends in Poland. It analyzes the factors influencing the inward FDI in Poland, such as: economic stability, cost of labor, EU membership, regulatory framework. It presents the current FDI trends in Poland, such as: number of foreign firms, geographic origin of inward FDI, inward vs. outward FDI. The future research will focus on the impact of inward FDI stock on economic growth in Poland. To analyze the impact of the FDI stock on output growth in the Polish economy, a model of the economic growth based on the production function will be used The accounting profession experienced a significant revolution when paper-based practices, such as manual bookkeeping of ledgers and trial balances, shifted to the use of specialised accounting software. However, most of the accounting software used by accounting firms were standalone packages that were not supported by the Web; therefore the demand from accounting firms for an integrated software that could act more like an overall business management system which could cater for various financial activities such as accounts, tax, payroll, administrative tasks and point of sales systems emerged. The demand for having a single integrated platform for all accounting services with greater accessibility to real time information gave rise to cloud based accounting software applications. The accelerating speed at which accounting firms are adopting cloud accounting software leads us to the primary research question of understanding the effects the introduction of cloud accounting software has on the operational cost of accounting firms. This study also aims to investigate the factors that motivate small accounting firms to embrace cloud technology. The primary method for data collection was through the distribution of questionnaires to 6 Small Accounting firms in Hamilton who have adopted the use of cloud accounting software. The researcher was able to gather some interesting findings from this study, in terms of understanding the effect of staff training and information technology costs that Accounting firms are faced with through the implementation of cloud accounting software. The majority of firms in this study agreed that they have experienced an overall increase in their operational costs, but believe that there has been an increase in their general organisational efficiency"	['8868299', '23063527', '46676355', '41118038', '63184856', '23064993', '62490297']	[[{'name': 'Britchenko, Igor'}, {'name': 'Hushtan, Tetyana'}, {'name': 'Lalakulych, Mariya'}], [{'name': 'Bosman, Rudi'}, {'name': 'Kukreja, Bhaviya'}], [{'name': 'Finnerty, John'}, {'name': 'Raymar, Steven'}, {'name': 'Zwecher, Michael'}], [{'name': 'Kilyar, Oleksandra'}], [{'name': 'Kornecki, Lucyna'}], [{'name': 'Bosman, Rudi'}, {'name': 'Manisha, Meenal'}]]	['Harmonization of accounting for public sector entities in accordance with the leading international standards: a comparison of Italy and Ukraine', 'The impact of cloud accounting', 'Accounting', 'Accounting policy as a tool of enterprise management system', 'FDI in Central and Eastern Europe: Business Environment and Current FDI Trends in Poland', 'Effect of cloud accounting on an accounting firm’s costs']	7.0	exploratory	0.5
75a39944-66e5-4725-b26c-6c9f6d130bef	phytohormones	"The phytohormones jasmonate, gibberellin, salicylate, and ethylene regulate an interconnected reprogramming network integrating root development with plant responses against microbes. The establishment of mutualistic ectomycorrhizal symbiosis requires the suppression of plant defense responses against fungi as well as the modification of root architecture and cortical cell wall properties. Here, we investigated the contribution of phytohormones and their crosstalk to the ontogenesis of ectomycorrhizae (ECM) between grey poplar (Populus tremula x alba) roots and the fungus Laccaria bicolor. To obtain the hormonal blueprint of developing ECM, we quantified the concentrations of jasmonates, gibberellins, and salicylate via liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. Subsequently, we assessed root architecture, mycorrhizal morphology, and gene expression levels (RNA sequencing) in phytohormone-treated poplar lateral roots in the presence or absence of L. bicolor. Salicylic acid accumulated in mid-stage ECM. Exogenous phytohormone treatment affected the fungal colonization rate and/or frequency of Hartig net formation. Colonized lateral roots displayed diminished responsiveness to jasmonate but regulated some genes, implicated in defense and cell wall remodelling, that were specifically differentially expressed after jasmonate treatment. Responses to salicylate, gibberellin, and ethylene were enhanced in ECM. The dynamics of phytohormone accumulation and response suggest that jasmonate, gibberellin, salicylate, and ethylene signalling play multifaceted roles in poplar L. bicolor ectomycorrhizal development Small RNAs (sRNAs), mainly including miRNAs and siRNAs, are ubiquitous in eukaryotes. sRNAs mostly negatively regulate gene expression via (post-)transcriptional gene silencing through DNA methylation, mRNA cleavage, or translation inhibition. The mechanisms of sRNA biogenesis and function in diverse biological processes, as well as the interactions between sRNAs and environmental factors, like (a)biotic stress, have been deeply explored. Phytohormones are central in the plant’s response to stress, and multiple recent studies highlight an emerging role for sRNAs in the direct response to, or the regulation of, plant hormonal pathways. In this review, we discuss recent progress on the unraveling of crossregulation between sRNAs and nine plant hormones The continuous need for new compounds with important medicinal activities has lead to the identification and characterization of various plant-derived natural products. As a part of this program, we studied the saponin production from two tropical medicinal plants Maesa argentea and M. lanceolata and evaluated several treatments to enhance their saponin production. In this experiment, we present the analyses of saponin production from greenhouse grown plants by means of TLC and HPLC-MS. We observed that the content of saponin from these plants varied depending on organ and physiological age of the plants. In addition, the impact of elicitors on saponin accumulation on in vitro grown plants was analyzed using TLC. The production of saponin was very stable and not affected by treatment with methyl jasmonate, and salicylic acid. In conclusion, Maesa saponins are constitutively produced in plants and the level of these compounds in plants is mainly affected by the developmental or physiological stage Somatic embryogenesis is widely preferred as the regeneration route for in vitro studies in cotton.

However, the regeneration efficiency through this approach is low; a problem that is believed to be as a result

of the biochemical properties of the plant. The objective of this study was to investigate possible relationships

between three biochemical factors (reducing sugars, phenols, and free amino acids) and somatic

embryogenesis. In vitro cultures of the different embryogenic and non-embryogenic cultivals were established.

The levels of reducing sugars, phenols and free amino acids were determined at different developmental stages

of the cultures. Higher levels of reducing sugars and lower level of phenol were observed in embryogenic

cultivars compared to their non-embryogenic counterparts. There was a general increase in the levels of free

amino acids, which decreased with time in the highly embryogenic cultivars, whereas the levels remained high

in the poorly embryogenic and non-embryogenic cultivars. The higher content of phenols and free amino acids

may be implicated in the poor somatic embryogenic response. The data show that there are factors that may

serve as markers of somatic embryogenesis in cotton, which need to be empirically determined for any

particular cultivar chosen for genetic improvement through embryogenesis As the presence of health-promoting substances has become a significant aspect of tomato fruit appreciation, this study investigated nutrient solution salinity as a tool to enhance carotenoid accumulation in cherry tomato fruit (Solanum lycopersicum L. cv. Juanita). Hereby, a key objective was to uncover the underlying mechanisms of carotenoid metabolism, moving away from typical black box research strategies. To this end, a greenhouse experiment with five salinity treatments (ranging from 2.0 to 5.0 decisiemens (dS) m(-1)) was carried out and a metabolomic fingerprinting approach was applied to obtain valuable insights on the complicated interactions between salinity treatments, environmental conditions, and the plant's genetic background. Hereby, several hundreds of metabolites were attributed a role in the plant's salinity response (at the fruit level), whereby the overall impact turned out to be highly depending on the developmental stage. In addition, 46 of these metabolites embraced a dual significance as they were ascribed a prominent role in carotenoid metabolism as well. Based on the specific mediating actions of the retained metabolites, it could be determined that altered salinity had only marginal potential to enhance carotenoid accumulation in the concerned tomato fruit cultivar. This study invigorates the usefulness of metabolomics in modern agriculture, for instance in modeling tomato fruit quality. Moreover, the metabolome changes that were caused by the different salinity levels may enclose valuable information towards other salinity-related plant processes as well"	['85869044', '85772602', '37979749', '30769812', '42933430']	[[{'name': 'Amirebrahimi, Mojgan'}, {'name': 'Barry, Kerrie W'}, {'name': 'Basso, Veronica'}, {'name': 'Block, Jonathan'}, {'name': 'Daguerre, Yohann'}, {'name': 'Grigoriev, Igor V'}, {'name': 'Guinet, Frédéric'}, {'name': 'Kohler, Annegret'}, {'name': 'Martin, Francis'}, {'name': 'Miyauchi, Shingo'}, {'name': 'Na, Hyunsoo'}, {'name': 'Novák, Ondřej'}, {'name': 'Singan, Vasanth'}, {'name': 'Veneault-Fourrey, Claire'}, {'name': 'Šimura, Jan'}], [{'name': 'Dubois, Marieke'}, {'name': 'Gonzalez Sanchez, Nathalie'}, {'name': 'Inzé, Dirk'}, {'name': 'Li, Ting'}], [{'name': 'Faizal, Ahmad'}, {'name': 'Geelen, Danny'}], [{'name': 'Obembe, Olawole O.'}], [{'name': 'Hanssens, Jochen'}, {'name': 'Steppe, Kathy'}, {'name': 'Van Meulebroek, Lieven'}, {'name': 'Vanhaecke, Lynn'}]]	['An ectomycorrhizal fungus alters sensitivity to jasmonate, salicylate, gibberellin, and ethylene in host roots.', 'Emerging connections between small RNAs and phytohormones', 'Studies on saponin production in tropical medicinal plants Maesa argentea and Maesa lanceolata', 'Endogenous levels of reducing sugars, free amino acids and phenols during\n\nvarious stages of in vitro culture of cotton (Gossypium Spp.)', 'Metabolic fingerprinting to assess the impact of salinity on carotenoid content in developing tomato fruits']	5.0	exploratory	0.5

performing very well on postgraduate-level questions. Many educators have found
that their take-home or remote tests and exams are vulnerable to ChatGPT-based
cheating because students may directly use answers provided by tools like
ChatGPT. In this paper, we try to provide an answer to an important question:
how well ChatGPT can answer test questions and how we can detect whether the
questions of a test can be answered correctly by ChatGPT. We generated
ChatGPT's responses to the MedMCQA dataset, which contains over 10,000 medical
school entrance exam questions. We analyzed the responses and uncovered certain
types of questions ChatGPT answers more inaccurately than others. In addition,
we have created a basic natural language processing model to single out the
most vulnerable questions to ChatGPT in a collection of questions or a sample
exam. Our tool can be used by test-makers to avoid ChatGPT-vulnerable test
questions.Comment: 2023 International Conference on Machine Learning and Applications
  (ICMLA This research examines the impact of ChatGPT as a learning aid for students in API testing. A controlled experiment compared two groups: one utilizing ChatGPT and the other relying on traditional documentation. The findings indicate that participants using ChatGPT scored significantly higher in both exam tests compared to the documentation group, despite taking longer to complete tasks. Statistical analysis using t-tests confirmed these differences as significant. Post-test surveys revealed an increase in participants confidence and effectiveness in understanding and using APIs after interacting with ChatGPT. However, potential downsides, such as over-reliance on ChatGPT and insufficient deep conceptual understanding, were also observed. The results suggest that while ChatGPT can greatly enhance the quality of learning and productivity in API-related tasks, users must balance AI assistance with independent problem-solving skills. This study underscores the potential of ChatGPT as a valuable educational tool, provided it is integrated thoughtfully into the learning process.This research examines the impact of ChatGPT as a learning aid for students in API testing.

This study underscores the potential of ChatGPT as a valuable educational tool, provided it is integrated thoughtfully into the learning process Latest developments in Artificial Intelligence (AI) and big data gave rise to
Artificial Intelligent agents like Open AI's ChatGPT, which has recently become
the fastest growing application since Facebook and WhatsApp. ChatGPT has
demonstrated its ability to impact students' classroom learning experience and
exam outcomes. However, there is evidence that ChatGPT provides biased and
erroneous information, yet students use ChatGPT in academic tasks. Therefore,
an accurate understanding of ChatGPT user perception is crucial. This study has
analyzed 247 Reddit top posts related to the educational use of ChatGPT from a
prominent subreddit called ""ChatGPT"" for user perception analysis. Descriptive
statistics, sentiment analysis using NLP techniques, and LDA topic modeling
were used for analysis to gather a contextual understanding of the data.
Results show that the majority of the users took a neutral viewpoint. However,
there was more positive perception than negative regarding the usefulness of
ChatGPT in education This paper analyses ChatGPT 3.5 Turbo, the latest free version of the ChatGPT service. By using ChatGPT to create theoretical papers on itself, further insights are gained into the potential of ChatGPT and other generative artificial intelligence services as well as their weaknesses. Through this analysis presented, potential future avenues of research are suggested alongside necessary changes if services like ChatGPT wish to be used as a tool in academic works ChatGPT is an artificial intelligence that can understand context and respond appropriately. It could be used for research on a topic. However, ChatGPT does not always provide accurate information. Its performance has not been tested in engineering fields. In this study, ChatGPT was consulted about concrete-filled tubes (CFT), which is a structural element primarily subjected to axial load. Fifty-eight questions were posted to ChatGPT. ChatGPT’s responses (370 sentences) were evaluated. ChatGPT generated plagiarism-free statements, with only a 12% Turnitin similarity index. 78.6% of ChatGPT’s sentences were long and complex. Thus, Hemingway Editor gave them a Grade 14 for poor readability. The information given by ChatGPT can be classified as correct, erroneous, contradictory, and unverified. ChatGPT could be used as a research tool, but with limitations. It can explain the basic concepts of CFT but also provide inaccurate and contradictory information. A researcher needs to be cautious while using ChatGPT in research. ChatGPT could be used to test some hypotheses or theories. However, the quality of the output is dependent on the user’s critical inputs and an in-depth conversation with ChatGPT The release of the large language model based chatbot ChatGPT in November
2022 has brought considerable attention to the subject of artificial
intelligence, not only in the public. From the perspective of higher education,
ChatGPT challenges various learning and assessment formats as it significantly
reduces the effectiveness of their learning and assessment functionalities. In
particular, ChatGPT might be applied to formats that require learners to
generate text, such as bachelor theses or student research papers. Accordingly,
the research question arises to what extent writing of bachelor theses is still
a valid learning and assessment format. Correspondingly, in this study, the
first author was asked to write his bachelor's thesis exploiting ChatGPT. For
tracing the impact of ChatGPT, methodically an autoethnographic approach was
used. First, all considerations on the potential use of ChatGPT were documented
in logs and secondly, all ChatGPT chats were logged. Both logs and chat
histories were analyzed and are presented along to the recommendations for
students regarding the use of ChatGPT suggested by Gimpel et al. (2023). In
conclusion, ChatGPT is beneficial in thesis writing during various activities,
such as brainstorming, structuring and text revision. However, there arise
limitations, e.g., in referencing. Thus, ChatGPT requires a continuous
validation of the outcomes generated fostering learning. Currently, ChatGPT is
to be valued as a beneficial tool in thesis writing. However, writing a
conclusive thesis still requires the learner's meaningful engagement.
Accordingly, writing a thesis is still a valid learning and assessment format.
With further releases of ChatGPT, an increase in capabilities is to be expected
and the research question needs to be reevaluated from time to time.Comment: 26 page This research investigated the use of ChatGPT for paraphrasing in the scope of thesis writing class at English study program. The informants for this research are six students in thesis writing class who used ChatGPT as their paraphrasing tool. The researcher used descriptive qualitative research design. To collect the data, the researcher uses semi-structured interviews and documentations.

Please cite the published version.Microplastic litter is a pervasive pollutant present in aquatic systems across the globe. A range of marine organisms have the capacity to ingest microplastics, resulting in adverse health effects. Developing methods to accurately quantify microplastics in productive marine waters, and those internalized by marine organisms, is of growing importance. Here we investigate the efficacy of using acid, alkaline and enzymatic digestion techniques in mineralizing biological material from marine surface trawls to reveal any microplastics present. Our optimized enzymatic protocol can digest >97% (by weight) of the material present in plankton-rich seawater samples without destroying any microplastic debris present. In applying the method to replicate marine samples from the western English Channel, we identified 0.27 microplastics m(-3). The protocol was further used to extract microplastics ingested by marine zooplankton under laboratory conditions. Our findings illustrate that enzymatic digestion can aid the detection of microplastic debris within seawater samples and marine biota.Natural Environment Research Council (NERC We describe results of modeling the effects on Earth-like planets of
long-duration gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) within a few kiloparsecs. A primary
effect is generation of nitrogen oxide compounds which deplete ozone. Ozone
depletion leads to an increase in solar UVB radiation at the surface, enhancing
DNA damage, particularly in marine microorganisms such as phytoplankton. In
addition, we expect increased atmospheric opacity due to buildup of nitrogen
dioxide produced by the burst and enhanced precipitation of nitric acid. We
review here previous work on this subject and discuss recent developments,
including further discussion of our estimates of the rates of impacting GRBs
and the possible role of short-duration bursts.Comment: 12 pages including 5 figures (4 in color). Added discussion of GRB

  Physics, for special issue ""Focus on Gamma-Ray Bursts Considerable variation exists in parasite virulence and host tolerance which may have a genetic and/or environmental basis. In this article, we study the effects of a striking, mouth-dwelling, blood-feeding isopod parasite (Ceratothoa italica) on the life history and physiological condition of two Mediterranean populations of the coastal fish, Lithognathus mormyrus. The growth and hepatosomatic index (HSI) of fish in a heavily human-exploited population were severely impacted by this parasite, whereas C. italica showed negligible virulence in fish close to a marine protected area. In particular, for HSI, the parasite load explained 34.4% of the variation in HSI in the exploited population, whereas there was no significant relationship (0.3%) between parasite load and HSI for fish in the marine protected area. Both host and parasite populations were not differentiated for neutral genetic variation and were likely to exchange migrants. We discuss the role of local genetic adaptation and phenotypic plasticity, and how deteriorated environmental conditions with significant fishing pressure can exacerbate the effects of parasitism. © 2012 The Linnean Society of London, Biological Journal of the Linnean Society, 2012, 105, 842–852 Journal ArticleThe major function of the venoms of the predatory marine snails belonging to the genus Conus is to paralyze prey.

Reslizumab 3 mg/kg administered intravenously is approved for the treatment of severe eosinophilic asthma. We assessed the safety and efficacy of subcutaneous reslizumab 110 mg in two trials in patients with uncontrolled severe asthma and increased blood eosinophils. The aim was to establish whether subcutaneous reslizumab 110 mg can reduce exacerbation rates in these patients (study 1) or reduce maintenance oral corticosteroid dose in patients with corticosteroid-dependent asthma (study 2).

METHODS:
Both studies were randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase 3 studies. Entry criteria for study 1 were uncontrolled severe asthma, two or more asthma exacerbations in the previous year, a blood eosinophil count of 300 cells per μL or more (including no more than 30% patients with an eosinophil count <400 cells/μL), and at least a medium dose of inhaled corticosteroids with one or more additional asthma controllers. Patients in study 2 had severe asthma, a blood eosinophil count of 300 cells per μL or more, daily maintenance oral corticosteroid (prednisone 5-40 mg, or equivalent), and high-dose inhaled corticosteroids plus another controller. Patients were randomly assigned (1:1) to subcutaneous reslizumab (110 mg) or placebo once every 4 weeks for 52 weeks in study 1 and 24 weeks in study 2. Patients and investigators were masked to treatment assignment. Primary efficacy outcomes were frequency of exacerbations during 52 weeks in study 1 and categorised percentage reduction in daily oral corticosteroid dose from baseline to weeks 20-24 in study 2. Primary efficacy analyses were by intention to treat, and safety analyses included all patients who received at least one dose of study treatment. These studies are registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT02452190 (study 1) and NCT02501629 (study 2).

FINDINGS:
Between Aug 12, 2015, and Jan 31, 2018, 468 patients in study 1 were randomly assigned to placebo (n=232) or subcutaneous reslizumab (n=236), and 177 in study 2 to placebo (n=89) or subcutaneous reslizumab (n=88). In study 1, we found no significant difference in the exacerbation rate between reslizumab and placebo in the intention-to-treat population (rate ratio 0·79, 95% CI 0·56-1·12; p=0·19). Subcutaneous reslizumab reduced exacerbation frequency compared with placebo in the subgroup of patients with blood eosinophil counts of 400 cells per μL or more (0·64, 95% CI 0·43-0·95). Greater reductions in annual exacerbation risk (p=0·0035) and longer time to first exacerbation were observed for patients with higher trough serum reslizumab concentrations. In study 2, we found no difference between placebo and fixed-dose subcutaneous reslizumab in categorised percentage reduction in daily oral corticosteroid dose (odds ratio for a lower category of oral corticosteroid use in the reslizumab group vs the placebo group, 1·23, 95% CI 0·70-2·16; p=0·47). The frequency of adverse events and serious adverse events with reslizumab were similar to those with placebo in both studies.

INTERPRETATION:
Fixed-dose (110 mg) subcutaneous reslizumab was not effective in reducing exacerbation frequency in patients with uncontrolled asthma and increased blood eosinophils (≥300 cells/μL), or in reducing the daily maintenance oral corticosteroid dose in patients with oral corticosteroid-dependent severe eosinophilic asthma. Higher exposures than those observed with 110 mg subcutaneous reslizumab are required to achieve maximal efficacy.

FUNDING:
Teva Branded Pharmaceutical Products R&D RATIONALE AND OBJECTIVES: Asthma is a heterogeneous disease driven by diverse immunologic and inflammatory mechanisms. We used transcriptomic profiling of airway tissues to help define asthma phenotypes. METHODS: The transcriptome from bronchial biopsies and epithelial brushings of 107 moderate-to-severe asthmatics were annotated by gene-set variation analysis (GSVA) using 42 gene-signatures relevant to asthma, inflammation and immune function. Topological data analysis (TDA) of clinical and histological data was used to derive clusters and the nearest shrunken centroid algorithm used for signature refinement. RESULTS: 9 GSVA signatures expressed in bronchial biopsies and airway epithelial brushings distinguished two distinct asthma subtypes associated with high expression of T-helper type 2 (Th-2) cytokines and lack of corticosteroid response (Group 1 and Group 3). Group 1 had the highest submucosal eosinophils, high exhaled nitric oxide (FeNO) levels, exacerbation rates and oral corticosteroid (OCS) use whilst Group 3 patients showed the highest levels of sputum eosinophils and had a high BMI. In contrast, Group 2 and Group 4 patients had an 86% and 64% probability of having non-eosinophilic inflammation. Using machine-learning tools, we describe an inference scheme using the currently-available inflammatory biomarkers sputum eosinophilia and exhaled nitric oxide levels along with OCS use that could predict the subtypes of gene expression within bronchial biopsies and epithelial cells with good sensitivity and specificity. CONCLUSION: This analysis demonstrates the usefulness of a transcriptomic-driven approach to phenotyping that segments patients who may benefit the most from specific agents that target Th2-mediated inflammation and/or corticosteroid insensitivity Background

An increase in serious adverse events with both regular formoterol and regular salmeterol in chronic asthma has been demonstrated in comparison with placebo in previous Cochrane reviews. This increase was significant in trials that did not randomise participants to an inhaled corticosteroid, but less certain in the smaller numbers of participants in trials that included an inhaled corticosteroid in the randomised treatment regimen.



Objectives

We set out to compare the risks of mortality and non-fatal serious adverse events in trials which have randomised patients with chronic asthma to regular formoterol versus regular salmeterol, when each are used with an inhaled corticosteroid as part of the randomised treatment.Search strategyTrials were identified using the Cochrane Airways Group Specialised Register of trials. Manufacturers' web sites of clinical trial registers were checked for unpublished trial data and Food and Drug Administration (FDA) submissions in relation to formoterol and salmeterol were also checked. The date of the most recent search was July 2009.



Selection criteria

Controlled clinical trials with a parallel design, recruiting patients of any age and severity of asthma were included if they randomised patients to treatment with regular formoterol versus regular salmeterol (each with a randomised inhaled corticosteroid), and were of at least 12 weeks duration.



Data collection and analysis

Two authors independently selected trials for inclusion in the review and extracted outcome data. Unpublished data on mortality and serious adverse events were sought from the sponsors and authors.



Main results

Eight studies met the eligibility criteria of the review recruiting 6,163 adults and adolescents. There were seven studies (involving 5,935 adults and adolescents) comparing formoterol and budesonide to salmeterol and fluticasone. All but one study administered the products as a combined inhaler, and most used formoterol 50 mcg and budesonide 400 mcg twice daily versus salmeterol 50 mcg and fluticasone 250 mcg twice daily. There were two deaths overall (one on each combination) and neither were thought to be related to asthma.There was no significant difference between treatment groups for non-fatal serious adverse events, either all-cause (Peto OR 1.14; 95% CI 0.82 to 1.59, I(2) = 26%) or asthma-related (Peto OR 0.69; 95% CI 0.37 to 1.26, I(2) = 33%). Over 23 weeks the rates for all-cause serious adverse events were 2.6% on formoterol and budesonide and 2.3% on salmeterol and fluticasone, and for asthma-related serious adverse events, 0.6% and 0.8% respectively.There was one study (228 adults) comparing formoterol and beclomethasone to salmeterol and fluticasone, but there were no deaths or hospital admissions.No studies were found in children.



Authors' conclusions 

The seven identified studies in adults did not show any significant difference in safety between formoterol and budesonide in comparison with salmeterol and fluticasone. Asthma-related serious adverse events were rare, and there were no reported asthma-related deaths. There was a single small study comparing formoterol and beclomethasone to salmeterol and fluticasone in adults, but no serious adverse events occurred in this study. No studies were found in children.Overall there is insufficient evidence to decide whether regular formoterol and budesonide or beclomethasone have equivalent or different safety profiles from salmeterol and fluticasone Background Long-term corticosteroid therapy is the standard of care for treatment of cardiac sarcoidosis (CS). The efficacy of long-term corticosteroid-sparing immunosuppression in CS is unknown. The goal of this study was to assess the efficacy of methotrexate with or without adalimumab for long-term disease suppression in CS, and to assess recurrence and adverse event rates after immunosuppression discontinuation. Methods and Results Retrospective chart review identified treatment-naive CS patients at a single academic medical center who received corticosteroid-sparing maintenance therapy. Demographics, cardiac uptake of 18-fluorodeoxyglucose, and adverse cardiac events were compared before and during treatment and between those with persistent or interrupted immunosuppression. Twenty-eight CS patients were followed for a mean 4.1 (SD 1.5) years. Twenty-five patients received 4 to 8&nbsp;weeks of high-dose prednisone (&gt;30&nbsp;mg/day), followed by taper and maintenance therapy with methotrexate±low-dose prednisone (low-dose prednisone, &lt;10&nbsp;mg/day). Adalimumab was added in 19 patients with persistently active CS or in those with intolerance to methotrexate. Methotrexate±low-dose prednisone resulted in initial reduction (88%) or elimination (60%) of 18-fluorodeoxyglucose uptake, and patients receiving adalimumab-containing regimens experienced improved (84%) or resolved (63%) 18-fluorodeoxyglucose uptake. Radiologic relapse occurred in 8 of 9 patients after immunosuppression cessation, 4 patients on methotrexate-containing regimens, and in no patients on adalimumab-containing regimens. Conclusions Corticosteroid-sparing regimens containing methotrexate with or without adalimumab is an effective maintenance therapy in patients after an initial response is confirmed. Disease recurrence in patients on and off immunosuppression support need for ongoing radiologic surveillance regardless of immunosuppression regimen Background
Systemic corticosteroids lead to many adverse effects
especially in cancer patients. Preventive measures and
treatment options are essential to minimise such side
effects.
Objectives
The aims of the study included the evaluation
of the prescribers’ management of corticosteroid
induced hyperglycaemia, dyspepsia, oral candidiasis
and proximal myopathy, the discussion of possible
reasons for non-adherence to guidelines, and the
recommendation of interventions to reduce their risk
of occurrence.
Method
A retrospective review of the medical records for 156
consecutive patients at oncology out-patients and in
oncology wards of Boffa Hospital between the 1st and the
14th September 2014 was performed. Only patients who
were on long term corticosteroids (>2 weeks’ duration)
were considered. Patients younger than 12 years of
age or those that were prescribed corticosteroids for
antiemetic purposes were excluded from the study. For
each of the sampled patients, any management aimed
at reducing corticosteroid side effects was compared
to the guidelines as stated in an article published in a
prominent international journal.
Results
From 156 cancer patients, 55 patients satisfied
the inclusion criteria. The mostly addressed side
effect was dyspepsia (n=35; 63.6%) followed by
proximal myopathy (n=27; 49%), hyperglycaemia
(n=24; 43.6%) and lastly oral candidiasis (n=20; 36%). Adherence to guidelines was as follows:
hyperglycaemia – haemo-glucose test (HGT) and
glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c) (36%); dyspepsia -
prescribing of omeprazole (51%) and ranitidine (5%);
oral candidiasis - orophargyngeal exam (29%); and
proximal myopathy (40% compliance; of which 35%
complying with resistance and endurance exercise
and 5% complying with steroid dose reduction).
Conclusion
Improvement is required with regards to the
management of corticosteroid side effects especially
for hyperglycaemia and oral candidiasis. Possible
actions that may be taken include strategies to
improve guideline awareness, the prescribing of the
lowest effective dose, adequate patient education and
the implementation of a steroid card.peer-reviewe Thesis (M.A.)--Boston UniversityObjective: The objective of this thesis was to assess outcomes of glenohumeral corticosteroid injections for adhesive capsulitis.
Design: The thesis was composed of two parts. First, a systematic literature review was conducted on glenohumeral corticosteroid injections on shoulder outcomes for adhesive capsulitis. Second, an original prospective study was conducted to measure the effect of ultrasound-guided injections on pain and function for adhesive capsulitis patients.
Setting: All injections for the prospective injection study were conducted at Brigham and Women’s Hospital in Boston, MA.
Patients: Inclusion criteria were patients receiving an ultrasound guided injection for adhesive capsulitis. 67 patients were included, 59 patients were available at first follow up, and 40 patients were available at final follow up.
Methods: The literature review was conducted using the online databases PubMed (1966-present), Embase (1947-present), Web of Science (1900–
present), and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials. Study criteria were limited to clinical trials that evaluated the application of corticosteroid injections, both alone and in combination with other treatment modalities, specifically for the condition of adhesive capsulitis in the shoulder. Studies involving non-corticosteroid injections or injections for conditions not specific to adhesive capsulitis were excluded. Results were limited to papers in the English language. A data table summarizing pain, function, and range of motion outcomes of each treatment was produced. A percent change from baseline was calculated to facilitate comparisons.

74739dfe-860c-4d45-a1b9-661ddaf5f3ac	adiposity	"Physical activity is critically important for successful aging, but its effect on adiposity markers at older ages is unclear as much of the evidence comes from self-reported data on physical activity. We assessed the associations of questionnaire-assessed and accelerometer-assessed physical activity with adiposity markers in older adults To identify genetic loci influencing central obesity and fat distribution, we performed a meta-analysis of 16 genome-wide association studies (GWAS, N = 38,580) informative for adult waist circumference (WC) and waist-hip ratio (WHR). We selected 26 SNPs for follow-up, for which the evidence of association with measures of central adiposity (WC and/or WHR) was strong and disproportionate to that for overall adiposity or height. Follow-up studies in a maximum of 70,689 individuals identified two loci strongly associated with measures of central adiposity; these map near TFAP2B (WC, P = 1.9x10(-11)) and MSRA (WC, P = 8.9x10(-9)). A third locus, near LYPLAL1, was associated with WHR in women only (P = 2.6x10(-8)). The variants near TFAP2B appear to influence central adiposity through an effect on overall obesity/fat-mass, whereas LYPLAL1 displays a strong female-only association with fat distribution. By focusing on anthropometric measures of central obesity and fat distribution, we have identified three loci implicated in the regulation of human adiposity Background: It is unclear whether cardiorespiratory fitness (CRF) is independently linked to cardiometabolic risk in children. This study investigated a) the association between CRF level and presence of cardiometabolic risk disorders using health-related cut points, and b) whether these associations were mediated by abdominal adiposity in children. Methods: This was a cross-sectional design study. Anthropometry, biochemical parameters and CRF were assessed in 147 schoolchildren (75 girls) aged 10-14 years. CRF was determined using a maximal cycle ergometer test. Children were classified as ‘fit’ or ‘unfit’ according to published thresholds. Logistic regression was used to investigate the odds of having individual and clustered cardiometabolic risk factors according to CRF level and whether abdominal adiposity mediated these associations. Results: Children classified as unfit had increased odds of presenting individual and clustered cardiometabolic risk factors (p  0.05). Conclusions: This study suggests that the association between CRF and cardiometabolic risk is mediated by abdominal adiposity in 10-14 year-old children and that abdominal adiposity may be a more important determinant of adverse cardiometabolic health in this age group Purpose. To quantify liver adiposity using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and to determine its association with metabolic profile in men with spinal cord injury (SCI). Materials and Methods. MRI analysis of liver adiposity by fat signal fraction (FSF) and visceral adipose tissue (VAT) was completed on twenty participants. Intravenous glucose tolerance test was conducted to measure glucose effectiveness (g) and insulin sensitivity (i ). Lipid panel, fasting glucose, glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c), and inflammatory cytokines were also analyzed. Results. Average hepatic FSF was 3.7% ± 2.1. FSF was positively related to TG, non-HDL-C, fasting glucose, HbA1c, VAT, and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-). FSF was negatively related to i and testosterone. FSF was positively related to VAT ( = 0.48,  = 0.032) and TNF- ( = 0.51,  = 0.016) independent of age, level of injury (LOI), and time since injury (TSI). The associations between FSF and metabolic profile were independent of VAT. Conclusions. MRI noninvasively estimated hepatic adiposity in men with chronic SCI. FSF was associated with dysfunction in metabolic profile, central adiposity, and inflammation. Importantly, liver adiposity influenced metabolic profile independently of VAT. These findings highlight the significance of quantifying liver adiposity after SCI to attenuate the development of metabolic disorders BACKGROUND: Atherosclerosis develops from childhood, but the determinants of this preclinical stage remain uncertain. We examined the relations of classic coronary risk factors, adiposity and its associated metabolic disturbances, to arterial distensibility (a marker of early arterial disease) in 13- to 15-year-olds, some of whom had previously been studied at ages 9 to 11 years. METHODS AND RESULTS: Brachial artery distensibility was measured by a noninvasive ultrasound technique in 471 British children in whom measures of adiposity, blood pressure, fasting blood lipids, and insulin had been made. All adiposity measures showed strong graded inverse relationships with distensibility. Inverse associations with distensibility were also observed for insulin resistance (homeostasis model assessment), diastolic pressure, C-reactive protein, and the number of metabolic syndrome components present, which had a graded relation to distensibility. Total and LDL cholesterol levels were also inversely related to distensibility, but less strongly than adiposity; homocysteine had no relation to distensibility. Although the relations of total and LDL cholesterol and diastolic pressure to distensibility had been present at 9 to 11 years of age, those of adiposity and insulin resistance were only apparent at 13 to 15 years. CONCLUSIONS: Adiposity and its metabolic consequences are associated with adverse changes in the arterial wall by the teenage years. The graded relation with increasing adiposity was stronger than that for cholesterol and was seen at body mass index levels well below those considered to represent ""obesity."" This emphasizes the importance of population-based strategies to control adiposity and its metabolic consequences in the young"	['18007742', '128852', '8803044', '62664211', '138010925']	[[{'name': 'Bell, JA'}, {'name': 'Cogranne, P'}, {'name': 'Elbaz, A'}, {'name': 'Kivimaki, M'}, {'name': 'Sabia, S'}, {'name': 'Singh-Manoux, A'}, {'name': 'van Hees, VT'}], [{'name': 'Abecasis, G'}, {'name': 'Almgren, P'}, {'name': 'Amin, N'}, {'name': 'Aulchenko, Y'}, {'name': 'Bandinelli, S'}, {'name': 'Barroso, I'}, {'name': 'Bennett, A'}, {'name': 'Bergman, R'}, {'name': 'Boehnke, M'}, {'name': 'Bonnycastle, L'}, {'name': 'Bumpstead, S'}, {'name': 'Caulfield, M'}, {'name': 'Chambers, J'}, {'name': 'Chanock, S'}, {'name': 'Cherkas, L'}, {'name': 'Chines, P'}, {'name': 'Coin, L'}, {'name': 'Collins, F'}, {'name': 'Cons, W'}, {'name': 'Consortia, HWPROCARDIS'}, {'name': 'Consortium, GIANT'}, {'name': 'Cooper, C'}, {'name': 'Crawford, G'}, {'name': 'Davey Smith, G'}, {'name': 'Day, I'}, {'name': 'Deloukas, P'}, {'name': 'Doering, A'}, {'name': 'Dominiczak, A'}, {'name': 'Doney, A'}, {'name': 'Drong, A'}, {'name': 'Ebrahim, S'}, {'name': 'Elliott, P'}, {'name': 'Erdos, MR'}, {'name': 'Estrada, K'}, {'name': 'Ferrucci, L'}, {'name': 'Fischer, G'}, {'name': 'Forouhi, N'}, {'name': 'Franks, P'}, {'name': 'Frayling, T'}, {'name': 'Gieger, C'}, {'name': 'Grallert, H'}, {'name': 'Groop, L'}, {'name': 'Groves, C'}, {'name': 'Grundy, S'}, {'name': 'Guiducci, C'}, {'name': 'Hadley, D'}, {'name': 'Hamsten, A'}, {'name': 'Hattersley, A'}, {'name': 'Havulinna, A'}, {'name': 'Heid, I'}, {'name': 'Herrera, B'}, {'name': 'Hirschhorn, J'}, {'name': 'Hofman, A'}, {'name': 'Holle, R'}, {'name': 'Holloway, J'}, {'name': 'Hu, F'}, {'name': 'Hunter, D'}, {'name': 'Illig, T'}, {'name': 'Isomaa, B'}, {'name': 'Jackson, A'}, {'name': 'Jacobs, L'}, {'name': 'Jameson, K'}, {'name': 'Jarvelin, MR'}, {'name': 'Jousilahti, P'}, {'name': 'Karpe, F'}, {'name': 'Kong, A'}, {'name': 'Kooner, J'}, {'name': 'Kuusisto, J'}, {'name': 'Laakso, M'}, {'name': 'Laitinen, J'}, {'name': 'Lakatta, E'}, {'name': 'Lamina, C'}, {'name': 'Lathrop, G'}, {'name': 'Lawlor, D'}, {'name': 'Lim, N'}, {'name': 'Lindgren, C'}, {'name': 'Loos, R'}, {'name': 'Luan, J'}, {'name': 'Lyon, H'}, {'name': 'Mangino, M'}, {'name': 'McArdle, W'}, {'name': 'McCarthy For The Giant Consortium, MI'}, {'name': 'McCarthy, M'}, {'name': 'Meitinger, T'}, {'name': 'Mohlke, K'}, {'name': 'Mooser, V'}, {'name': 'Morken, M'}, {'name': 'Morris, A'}, {'name': 'Morris, A'}, {'name': 'Munroe, P'}, {'name': 'Narisu, N'}, {'name': 'Nordstrom, A'}, {'name': 'Nordstrom, P'}, {'name': 'Oostra, B'}, {'name': 'Palmer, C'}, {'name': 'Payne, F'}, {'name': 'Peden, J'}, {'name': 'Peltonen, L'}, {'name': 'Prokopenko, I'}, {'name': 'Qi, L'}, {'name': 'Randall, J'}, {'name': 'Renstrom, F'}, {'name': 'Rivadeneira, F'}, {'name': 'Ruokonen, A'}, {'name': 'Salomaa, V'}, {'name': 'Samani, N'}, {'name': 'Sandhu, MS'}, {'name': 'Sanna, S'}, {'name': 'Scheet, P'}, {'name': 'Schlessinger, D'}, {'name': 'Scott, L'}, {'name': 'Scuteri, A'}, {'name': 'Silander, K'}, {'name': 'Smith, G'}, {'name': 'Song, K'}, {'name': 'Soranzo, N'}, {'name': 'Spector, T'}, {'name': 'Speliotes, E'}, {'name': 'Stefansson, K'}, {'name': 'Steinthorsdottir, V'}, {'name': 'Strachan, D'}, {'name': 'Stringham, H'}, {'name': 'Swift, A'}, {'name': 'Tanaka, T'}, {'name': 'Thorleifsson, G'}, {'name': 'Thorsteinsdottir, U'}, {'name': 'Timpson, N'}, {'name': 'Tuomi, T'}, {'name': 'Tuomilehto, J'}, {'name': 'Uda, M'}, {'name': 'Uitterlinden, A'}, {'name': 'van Duijn, C'}, {'name': 'Vollenweider, P'}, {'name': 'Waeber, G'}, {'name': 'Wallace, C'}, {'name': 'Walters, G'}, {'name': 'Wareham, N'}, {'name': 'Waterworth, D'}, {'name': 'Watkins For The Procardis Consortia, H'}, {'name': 'Weedon, M'}, {'name': 'Wichmann, H'}, {'name': 'Willer, C'}, {'name': 'Witteman, J'}, {'name': 'Yuan, X'}, {'name': 'Zhang, C'}, {'name': 'Zhang, W'}, {'name': 'Zhao, J'}, {'name': 'Zillikens, M'}], [{'name': 'Bailey, Daniel Paul'}, {'name': 'Denton, Sarah J.'}, {'name': 'Kerr, Catherine J.'}, {'name': 'Savory, Louise A.'}], [{'name': 'Gorgey, Ashraf S.'}, {'name': 'Khan, M.

ea123fa2-fb45-4810-b7f4-558be54c1ead	nature	This site explains the effects of rising sea levels due to global warming. According to the information found here, rising seas will increase coastal erosion, pollution, storm damage, and flooding. They'll pose threats to coastal roads, bridges, jetties, breakwaters, docks, piers, and waterfront property and intruding salt water might contaminate groundwater supplies and threaten landfill and hazardous-waste sites. Also described are the effects on coastal estuaries, rich and productive tidal flats, and tidal wetlands that not only act as nurseries to most of our important marine fishes and shellfishes, but also filter many dangerous pollutants that rivers and creeks carry downstream to the estuary and also buffer the effects of storms and floods. Educational levels: High school, Middle school Quantum coherence-induced effects in atomic and molecular systems are the basis of several proposals for laser-based control of chemical reactions. So far, these rely on coherent photon beams inducing coherent reaction pathways that may interfere with one another, in order to achieve the desired outcome. This concept has been successfully exploited for removing the inversion symmetry in the dissociation of homonuclear diatomic molecules, but it remains to be seen if such quantum coherent effects can also be generated by interaction of incoherent electrons with such molecules. Here we show that resonant electron attachment to H2 and the subsequent dissociation into H (n=2) + H− is asymmetric about the inter-nuclear axis, while the asymmetry in D2 is far less pronounced. We explain this observation as due to attachment of a single electron resulting in a coherent superposition of two resonances of opposite parity. In addition to exemplifying a new quantum coherent process, our observation of coherent quantum dynamics involves the active participation of all three electrons and two nuclei, which could provide new tools for studying electron correlations as a means to control chemical processes and demonstrates the role of coherent effects in electron induced chemistry Nature and civilization are often regarded in opposition to each other. However, civilization employs technologies and is based on laws of nature. Also, the historical world is a result of the development of the natural world. An “anti-nature” must thus be contained somewhere within nature. The idea of “anti-nature” is neither alien to the Eastern nor to the Western traditional concepts of nature. The philosophy of Lao Zi never embraces mere naturalism. Lao Zi has observed that things in the world are not always “so on their own” but rather in the mode of anti-nature. Anti-nature in nature itself does not become expressive until Christian theology, in which the origin of evil is reflected upon. The last part of the paper begins with one Buddhist thought expressed in the Diamond Sutra: “The world is not the world that is named the world.” Through naming of a thing, this thing is objectified or substantialized, and an objectified thing is not the thing itself. This self is “śūnya”, a non-world, which is what the world is. This non-world (as well nature) is first and foremost concealed by ego-consciousness that tends to objectify the things. Ego-consciousness as this anti-nature tends to conceal this non-nature, and begins to act in the form of technology. The radical way of solving the problems caused by this “anti-nature” must begin with gaining an insight into the nature of ourselves as well as the nature of technology This piece of creative non-fiction describes my relationship with National Parks and the way their beauty and power has shaped my life The essay is divided into three parts. Part I considers the ways in which the need for environmental law derives from the tendency of human nature to cause adverse environmental consequences and the ways in which the laws of nature make it more difficult to prevent those consequences absent the imposition of external legal rules. Part II describes how our nation\u27s lawmaking institutions are similarly challenged by the laws of nature. This includes a discussion of how the kinds of laws necessary to bridge the gap between human nature and the laws of nature are systematically difficult for our lawmaking institutions to develop in the first instance and to maintain over time.

3d1403e3-9a18-4752-8779-9e0a5c7eb8cb	versican	"The ADAMTS (A Disintegrin and Metalloproteinase with Thrombospondin motifs) enzymes are secreted, multi-domain matrix-associated zinc metalloendopeptidases that have diverse roles in tissue morphogenesis and patho-physiological remodeling, in inflammation and in vascular biology. The human family includes 19 members that can be sub-grouped on the basis of their known substrates, namely the aggrecanases or proteoglycanases (ADAMTS1, 4, 5, 8, 9, 15 and 20), the procollagen N-propeptidases (ADAMTS2, 3 and 14), the cartilage oligomeric matrix protein-cleaving enzymes (ADAMTS7 and 12), the von-Willebrand Factor proteinase (ADAMTS13) and a group of orphan enzymes (ADAMTS6, 10, 16, 17, 18 and 19). Control of the structure and function of the extracellular matrix (ECM) is a central theme of the biology of the ADAMTS, as exemplified by the actions of the procollagen-N-propeptidases in collagen fibril assembly and of the aggrecanases in the cleavage or modification of ECM proteoglycans. Defects in certain family members give rise to inherited genetic disorders, while the aberrant expression or function of others is associated with arthritis, cancer and cardiovascular disease. In particular, ADAMTS4 and 5 have emerged as therapeutic targets in arthritis. Multiple ADAMTSs from different sub-groupings exert either positive or negative effects on tumorigenesis and metastasis, with both metalloproteinase-dependent and -independent actions known to occur. The basic ADAMTS structure comprises a metalloproteinase catalytic domain and a carboxy-terminal ancillary domain, the latter determining substrate specificity and the localization of the protease and its interaction partners; ancillary domains probably also have independent biological functions. Focusing primarily on the aggrecanases and proteoglycanases, this review provides a perspective on the evolution of the ADAMTS family, their links with developmental and disease mechanisms, and key questions for the future SummaryWe show that combinatorial mouse alleles for the secreted metalloproteases Adamts5, Adamts20 (bt), and Adamts9 result in fully penetrant soft-tissue syndactyly. Interdigital webs in Adamts5−/−;bt/bt mice had reduced apoptosis and decreased cleavage of the proteoglycan versican; however, the BMP-FGF axis, which regulates interdigital apoptosis was unaffected. BMP4 induced apoptosis, but without concomitant versican proteolysis. Haploinsufficiency of either Vcan or Fbln1, a cofactor for versican processing by ADAMTS5, led to highly penetrant syndactyly in bt mice, suggesting that cleaved versican was essential for web regression. The local application of an aminoterminal versican fragment corresponding to ADAMTS-processed versican, induced cell death in Adamts5−/−;bt/bt webs. Thus, ADAMTS proteases cooperatively maintain versican proteolysis above a required threshold to create a permissive environment for apoptosis. The data highlight the developmental significance of proteolytic action on the ECM, not only as a clearance mechanism, but also as a means to generate bioactive versican fragments Versican is the principal large proteoglycan expressed in mid-tendon, but its role in tendon pathology is unknown. Our objective was to define the expression of versican isoform splice variant messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA) in normal Achilles tendons, in chronic painful tendinopathy and in ruptured tendons. Total RNA isolated from frozen tendon samples (normal n = 14; chronic painful tendinopathy n = 10; ruptured n = 8) was assayed by relative quantitative reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) for total versican, versican variants V0, V1, V2, V3 and type I collagen a1 mRNA, normalized to glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH). Differences between sample groups were tested by Wilcoxon statistics. Painful and ruptured tendons showed a significant decrease (median 2-fold) in the expression of versican mRNA, in contrast to an increased expression (median 8-fold) of type I collagen a1 mRNA in painful tendons. Versican splice variants V0 and V1 mRNA were readily detected in normal samples, V3 levels were substantially lower, and V2 levels were more variable. Each of V1, V2 and V3 mRNA showed significant decreases in expression in painful and ruptured tendons, but V0 was not significantly changed. Changes in versican expression relative to that of collagen, and alterations in the balance of versican splice variants, may contribute to changes in matrix structure and function in tendinopathies The extracellular matrix (ECM) proteoglycan, versican increases along with other ECM versican binding molecules such as hyaluronan, tumor necrosis factor stimulated gene-6 (TSG-6), and inter alpha trypsin inhibitor (IαI) during inflammation in a number of different diseases such as cardiovascular and lung disease, autoimmune diseases, and several different cancers. These interactions form stable scaffolds which can act as ""landing strips"" for inflammatory cells as they invade tissue from the circulation. The increase in versican is often coincident with the invasion of leukocytes early in the inflammatory process. Versican interacts with inflammatory cells either indirectly via hyaluronan or directly via receptors such as CD44, P-selectin glycoprotein ligand-1 (PSGL-1), and toll-like receptors (TLRs) present on the surface of immune and non-immune cells. These interactions activate signaling pathways that promote the synthesis and secretion of inflammatory cytokines such as TNFα, IL-6, and NFκB. Versican also influences inflammation by interacting with a variety of growth factors and cytokines involved in regulating inflammation thereby influencing their bioavailability and bioactivity. Versican is produced by multiple cell types involved in the inflammatory process. Conditional total knockout of versican in a mouse model of lung inflammation demonstrated significant reduction in leukocyte invasion into the lung and reduced inflammatory cytokine expression. While versican produced by stromal cells tends to be pro-inflammatory, versican expressed by myeloid cells can create anti-inflammatory and immunosuppressive microenvironments. Inflammation in the tumor microenvironment often contains elevated levels of versican. Perturbing the accumulation of versican in tumors can inhibit inflammation and tumor progression in some cancers. Thus versican, as a component of the ECM impacts immunity and inflammation through regulating immune cell trafficking and activation. Versican is emerging as a potential target in the control of inflammation in a number of different diseases It has been proposed that hyaluronan-binding proteoglycans play an important role as guiding cues during neural crest (NC) cell migration, but their precise function has not been elucidated. In this study, we examine the distribution, structure and putative role of the two major hyaluronan-binding proteoglycans, PG-M/versicans and aggrecan, during the course of avian NC development. PG-M/versicans V0 and V1 are shown to be the prevalent isoforms at initial and advanced phases of NC cell movement, whereas the V2 and V3 transcripts are first detected following gangliogenesis. During NC cell dispersion, mRNAs for PG-M/versicans V0/V1 are transcribed by tissues lining the NC migratory pathways, as well as by tissues delimiting nonpermissive areas. Immunohistochemistry confirm the deposition of the macromolecules in these regions and highlight regional differences in the density of these proteoglycans. PG-M/versicans assembled within the sclerotome rearrange from an initially uniform distribution to a preferentially caudal localization, both at the mRNA and protein level. This reorganization is a direct consequence of the metameric NC cell migration through the rostral portion of the somites. As suggested by previous in situ hybridizations, aggrecan shows a virtually opposite distribution to PG-M/versicans being confined to the perinotochordal ECM and extending dorsolaterally in a segmentally organized manner eventually to the entire spinal cord at axial levels interspacing the ganglia. PG-M/versicans purified from the NC migratory routes are highly polydispersed, have an apparent M(r) of 1,200-2,000 kDa, are primarily substituted with chondroitin-6-sulfates and, upon chondroitinase ABC digestion, are found to be composed of core proteins with apparent M(r)of 360–530, 000. TEM/rotary shadowing analysis of the isolated PG-M/versicans confirmed that they exhibit the characteristic bi-globular shape, have core proteins with sizes predicted for the V0/V1 isoforms and carry relatively few extended glycosaminoglycan chains. Orthotopical implantation of PG-M/versicans immobilized onto transplantable micromembranes tend to ‘attract’ moving cells toward them, whereas similar implantations of a notochordal type-aggrecan retain both single and cohorts of moving NC cells in close proximity of the implant and thereby perturb their spatiotemporal migratory pattern. NC cells fail to migrate through three-dimensional collagen type I-aggrecan substrata in vitro, but locomote in a haptotactic manner through collagen type I-PG-M/versican V0 substrata via engagement of HNK-1 antigen-bearing cell surface components. The present data suggest that PG-M/versicans and notochordal aggrecan exert divergent guiding functions during NC cell dispersion, which are mediated by both their core proteins and glycosaminoglycan side chains and may involve ‘haptotactic-like’ motility phenomena. Whereas aggrecan defines strictly impenetrable embryonic areas, PG-M/versicans are central components of the NC migratory pathways favoring the directed movement of the cells The vascular extracellular matrix (ECM) is essential for the structural integrity of the vessel wall and also serves as a substrate for the binding and retention of secreted products of vascular cells as well as molecules coming from the circulation. Although proteomics has been previously applied to vascular tissues, few studies have specifically targeted the vascular ECM and its associated proteins. Thus, its detailed composition remains to be characterized. In this study, we describe a methodology for the extraction of extracellular proteins from human aortas and their identification by proteomics. The approach is based on (a) effective decellularization to enrich for scarce extracellular proteins, (b) successful solubilization and deglycosylation of ECM proteins, and (c) relative estimation of protein abundance using spectral counting. Our three-step extraction approach resulted in the identification of 103 extracellular proteins of which one-third have never been reported in the proteomics literature of vascular tissues. In particular, three glycoproteins (podocan, sclerostin, and agrin) were identified for the first time in human aortas at the protein level. We also identified extracellular adipocyte enhancer-binding protein 1, the cartilage glycoprotein asporin, and a previously hypothetical protein, retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) spondin. Moreover, our methodology allowed us to screen for proteolysis in the aortic samples based on the identification of proteolytic enzymes and their corresponding degradation products. For instance, we were able to detect matrix metalloproteinase-9 by mass spectrometry and relate its presence to degradation of fibronectin in a clinical specimen. We expect this proteomics methodology to further our understanding of the composition of the vascular extracellular environment, shed light on ECM remodeling and degradation, and provide insights into important pathological processes, such as plaque rupture, aneurysm formation, and restenosis"	['8700706', '5848964', '1186991', '8850608', '2263080', '4342564']	[[{'name': 'A Colige'}, {'name': 'A Didangelos'}, {'name': 'A Luque'}, {'name': 'A Moncada-Pazos'}, {'name': 'A Noel'}, {'name': 'A Tan Ide'}, {'name': 'AC Jonsson-Rylander'}, {'name': 'AC Nicholson'}, {'name': 'AJ Fosang'}, {'name': 'B Joe'}, {'name': 'BH Koo'}, {'name': 'BH Koo'}, {'name': 'BV Nusgens'}, {'name': 'C Casal'}, {'name': 'C Esselens'}, {'name': 'C Gendron'}, {'name': 'C Kintakas'}, {'name': 'C Lopez-Otin'}, {'name': 'C Ricciardelli'}, {'name': 'CB Kern'}, {'name': 'CG Viloria'}, {'name': 'CH Mjaatvedt'}, {'name': 'CJ Liu'}, {'name': 'CJ Liu'}, {'name': 'CL Jacobi'}, {'name': 'CM Dancevic'}, {'name': 'CN Brocker'}, {'name': 'CR Flannery'}, {'name': 'D Wagsater'}, {'name': 'DL Russell'}, {'name': 'DL Silver'}, {'name': 'DR Edwards'}, {'name': 'DR McCulloch'}, {'name': 'DT Jones'}, {'name': 'Dylan R Edwards'}, {'name': 'EA Lin'}, {'name': 'EC Arner'}, {'name': 'ED Karagiannis'}, {'name': 'EM Majerus'}, {'name': 'F Guo'}, {'name': 'F Vazquez'}, {'name': 'FG Brunet'}, {'name': 'FX Gomis-Ruth'}, {'name': 'FX Gomis-Ruth'}, {'name': 'G Gao'}, {'name': 'G Gao'}, {'name': 'G Hashimoto'}, {'name': 'G Murphy'}, {'name': 'GC Choi'}, {'name': 'GE Lind'}, {'name': 'GG Levy'}, {'name': 'GJ Wayne'}, {'name': 'Grant N Wheeler'}, {'name': 'H Enomoto'}, {'name': 'H Jin'}, {'name': 'H Stanton'}, {'name': 'H Stanton'}, {'name': 'HL Lung'}, {'name': 'HM Brown'}, {'name': 'I Abbaszade'}, {'name': 'I Peluso'}, {'name': 'Ines Desanlis'}, {'name': 'J Dubail'}, {'name': 'J Dubail'}, {'name': 'J Felsenstein'}, {'name': 'J Hofsteenge'}, {'name': 'J Huxley-Jones'}, {'name': 'J Huxley-Jones'}, {'name': 'J Morales'}, {'name': 'JA Pyun'}, {'name': 'JC Adams'}, {'name': 'JC Rodriguez-Manzaneque'}, {'name': 'JC Rodriguez-Manzaneque'}, {'name': 'JC Rodriguez-Manzaneque'}, {'name': 'JD Sandy'}, {'name': 'JM Longpre'}, {'name': 'K Demircan'}, {'name': 'K Fujikawa'}, {'name': 'K Gopalakrishnan'}, {'name': 'K Kuno'}, {'name': 'K Kuno'}, {'name': 'K Stankunas'}, {'name': 'K Tamura'}, {'name': 'K Yamamoto'}, {'name': 'K Yamamoto'}, {'name': 'L Angerer'}, {'name': 'L Faivre'}, {'name': 'L Mittaz'}, {'name': 'L Mosyak'}, {'name': 'L Troeberg'}, {'name': 'L Troeberg'}, {'name': 'L Troeberg'}, {'name': 'L Wagstaff'}, {'name': 'LA Collins-Racie'}, {'name': 'LE Dupuis'}, {'name': 'LM Ricketts'}, {'name': 'M Cudic'}, {'name': 'M Hour El'}, {'name': 'M Kashiwagi'}, {'name': 'M Krampert'}, {'name': 'M Llamazares'}, {'name': 'MA Aldahmesh'}, {'name': 'MD Tortorella'}, {'name': 'MN Vankemmelbeke'}, {'name': 'N Dagoneau'}, {'name': 'N Hattori'}, {'name': 'N Rocks'}, {'name': 'N Rocks'}, {'name': 'N Stupka'}, {'name': 'NH Lim'}, {'name': 'NV Lee'}, {'name': 'NV Lee'}, {'name': 'P Wang'}, {'name': 'PH Lo'}, {'name': 'PJ Koshy'}, {'name': 'PS Chockalingam'}, {'name': 'R Kelwick'}, {'name': 'RC Salter'}, {'name': 'RH Song'}, {'name': 'Richard Kelwick'}, {'name': 'RL Robker'}, {'name': 'RP Somerville'}, {'name': 'RP Somerville'}, {'name': 'RS Patel'}, {'name': 'S Abdul-Majeed'}, {'name': 'S Gerhardt'}, {'name': 'S Kumar'}, {'name': 'S Kumar'}, {'name': 'S Nandadasa'}, {'name': 'S Porter'}, {'name': 'S Porter'}, {'name': 'SS Apte'}, {'name': 'SS Glasson'}, {'name': 'T Fontanil'}, {'name': 'T Shindo'}, {'name': 'TN Wight'}, {'name': 'U Auf Dem Keller'}, {'name': 'W Du'}, {'name': 'W Zeng'}, {'name': 'WE Kutz'}, {'name': 'WM Wang'}, {'name': 'X Lu'}, {'name': 'X Pu'}, {'name': 'XL Zheng'}, {'name': 'YJ Liu'}, {'name': 'YP Hsu'}], [{'name': 'Apte'}, {'name': 'Arner'}, {'name': 'Aspberg'}, {'name': 'Bandyopadhyay'}, {'name': 'Barth'}, {'name': 'Bode-Lesniewska'}, {'name': 'Boulet'}, {'name': 'Cooley'}, {'name': 'Courtney M.

90a175c9-f625-439a-9552-2f8477f61b39	hair	In the United States Black hair is viewed negatively because of its difference. Black females often deal with societal pressures to alter their kinky, curly hair from its natural state. To date, the social pressure of adopting a more Eurocentric (reflective of European descent—such as long, straight hair) look begins at an early age through socialization. The Eurocentric beauty standard plays a huge role in Black women’s positive self-identity and their perceptions of their own beauty. At an early age, specifically between ages three and four, African American children have a good understanding of what “good” hair means and the social hierarchy it can create for themselves (Bellinger 2007). Black females are constantly told that they have “nappy” or “bad hair” and begin to internalize self-hatred. Theorists suggest, that this self-hatred journey begins at home, as a result of constantly being teased about their tight curly coils from many sources and close ties. As a result Black women receive messages that “nappy” hair is undesirable (Robinson 2011). In addition, Black females often have their hair straightened, relaxed, or chemically altered because of the societal pressures that remind them that their hair in its natural state is not acceptable or presentable in society (White 2005). One can argue that this is the case for the majority of Black females with “wild” curly hair, who have a weekly ritual, spend hundreds of dollars, and spend numerous hours trying to attain the White western ideal image. This is problematic in the Black community because Black women are constantly oppressed and devalued based on their physical appearance, essentially being brainwashed into erasing their cultural identity. This is detrimental to the Black community due to the fact that Blacks are encouraged further distance themselves from their cultural roots, while forcing Blacks to abandon their African hair traditions (Randle 2015). In this paper, “good hair” is defined as hair that minimizes African ancestry and is more reflective of a European, Native, or Asian ancestry within the Black individual, it is usually wavy or straight in texture, and long. “Bad hair” is the extreme opposite of good hair—tightly coiled, thicker, and more likely to be short, clearly reflecting African ancestry (Robinson 2011). Further, Black females endure a host of negative effects due to the lack of available options to learn and care about natural afro hair which has created an enduring interlocking system of oppression for African American women that inhibits Black females from being free to express themselves and their beauty in a way that does not revolve around the Eurocentric standards. (White 2005). Racialized beauty standards combined with the color complex make hair texture and length an essential part of Black female identity (Randle 2015). Using an Afrocentric Black feminist perspective, I seek to understand how the Eurocentric standard of beauty negatively affects Black women’s positive self-identity and enhances their struggle to embrace their natural hair. This paper will explore the history of Black hair, Black hair politics, Black hair in the workplace, and discuss how Black females who choose to wear their hair natural is a form of empowerment while simultaneously challenging social norms Biomarkers of environmental metal exposure in children are important for elucidating exposure and health risk. While exposure biomarkers for As, Cd, and Pb are relatively well defined, there are not yet well-validated biomarkers of Mn exposure. Here, we measured hair Mn, Pb, Cd, and As levels in children from the Mid-Ohio Valley to determine within and between-subject predictors of hair metal levels. Occipital scalp hair was collected in 2009-2010 from 222 children aged 6-12 years (169 female, 53 male) participating in a study of chemical exposure and neurodevelopment in an industrial region of the Mid-Ohio Valley. Hair samples from females were divided into three two centimeter segments, while males provided a single segment. Hair was cleaned and processed in a trace metal clean laboratory, and analyzed for As, Cd, Mn, and Pb by magnetic sector inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry. Hair Mn and Pb levels were comparable (median 0.11 and 0.15 µg/g, respectively) and were ~10-fold higher than hair Cd and As levels (0.007 and 0.018 µg/g, respectively). Hair metal levels were higher in males compared to females, and varied by ~100-1000-fold between all subjects, and substantially less (&lt;40-70%) between segments within female subjects. Hair Mn, Pb, and Cd, but not As levels systematically increased by ~40-70% from the proximal to distal hair segments of females. There was a significant effect of season of hair sample collection on hair Mn, Pb, and Cd, but not As levels. Finally, hair metal levels reported here are ~2 to &gt;10-fold lower than levels reported in other studies in children, most likely because of more rigorous hair cleaning methodology used in the present study, leading to lower levels of unresolved exogenous metal contamination of hair Since many radioisotopes accumulate in hair, this tropism was investigated by comparing the radioactivity of shaved with plucked hair collected from rats at various time intervals up to 24 hrs after intravenous injection of the ecologically important radioisotopes, iodine-131, manganese-54, strontium-85, and zinc-65. The plucked hair includes the hair follicles where biochemical transformations are taking place. The data indicate a slight surge of each radioisotpe into the hair immediately after injection, a variation of content of each radionuclide in the hair, and a greater accumulation of radioactivity in plucked than in shaved hair. These results have application not only to hair as a measure of exposure to radioisotopes, but also to tissue damage and repair at the hair follicle Alopecia areata is an autoimmune disease that results in non-scarring hair loss, and it is clinically characterised by small patches of baldness on the scalp and/or around the body. It can later progress to total loss of scalp hair (Alopecia totalis) and/or total loss of all body hair (Alopecia universalis). The rapid rate of hair loss and disfiguration caused by the condition causes anxiety on patients and increases the risks of developing psychological and psychiatric complications. Hair loss in alopecia areata is caused by lymphocytic infiltrations around the hair follicles and IFN-γ. IgG antibodies against the hair follicle cells are also found in alopecia areata sufferers. In addition, the disease coexists with other autoimmune disorders and can come secondary to infections or inflammation. However, despite the growing knowledge about alopecia areata, the aetiology and pathophysiology of disease are not well defined. In this review we discuss various genetic and environmental factors that cause autoimmunity and describe the immune mechanisms that lead to hair loss in alopecia areata patients © The Author(s) 2019.

First, we assessed the efficacy of the 3 protocols, alone or in combination, on excised porcine skin and human hair contaminated with either methyl salicylate (MS), phorate (PHR), sodium fluoroacetate (SFA), or potassium cyanide (KCN). A second experiment investigated the residual hair contamination following decontamination with the triple protocol at different intervals postexposure. In a third experiment, hair decontaminated after exposure to MS or PHR was evaluated for off-gassing. Though skin decontamination was highly effective, a substantial proportion (20%–40%) of the lipophilic compounds (MS and PHR) remained within the hair. The more water-soluble contaminants (SFA and KCN) tended to form much smaller reservoirs within the hair. Interestingly, substantial off-gassing of MS, a medium volatility chemical, was detectable from triple-decontaminated hair up to 5 days postexposure. Overall, the decontamination strategies investigated were effective for the decontamination of skin, but less so for hair. These findings highlight the importance of contaminated hair serving as a source of potential secondary contamination by contact or inhalation. Therefore, consideration should be given to the removal of contaminated hair following exposure to toxic chemicals.Peer reviewe	['62690690', '85859116', '2445218', '4469098', '2444616', '8752553', '8791049']	[[{'name': 'Bencosme, Yamilex'}], [{'name': 'Jursa, Thomas'}, {'name': 'Smith, Donald R'}, {'name': 'Stein, Cheryl R'}], [{'name': 'Hair, G.'}], [{'name': 'Flynn, A.'}, {'name': 'Fratianne, R.

baa647b3-fbc2-4c1a-97b6-297b17e843aa	spectroscopy	"The AdS/CFT correspondence relates dibaryons in superconformal gauge theories
to holomorphic curves in Kaehler-Einstein surfaces. The degree of the
holomorphic curves is proportional to the gauge theory conformal dimension of
the dibaryons. Moreover, the number of holomorphic curves should match, in an
appropriately defined sense, the number of dibaryons. Using AdS/CFT backgrounds
built from the generalized conifolds of Gubser, Shatashvili, and Nekrasov
(1999), we show that the gauge theory prediction for the dimension of
dibaryonic operators does indeed match the degree of the corresponding
holomorphic curves. For AdS/CFT backgrounds built from cones over del Pezzo
surfaces, we are able to match the degree of the curves to the conformal
dimension of dibaryons for the n'th del Pezzo surface, n=1,2,...,6. Also, for
the del Pezzos and the A_k type generalized conifolds, for the dibaryons of
smallest conformal dimension, we are able to match the number of holomorphic
curves with the number of possible dibaryon operators from gauge theory.Comment: 30 pages, 6 figures, corrected refs; v3 typos correcte Rich and complex dark sectors are abundant in particle physics theories. Here
we propose performing spectroscopy of the mass structure of dark sectors via
mono-photon searches at lepton colliders. The energy of the mono-photon tracks
the invariant mass of the invisible system it recoils against, which enables
studying the resonance structure of the dark sector. We demonstrate this idea
with several well-motivated models of dark sectors. Such spectroscopy
measurements could potentially be performed at Belle II, BES-III and future
low-energy lepton colliders.Comment: 6 pages, 5 figure Spectroscopy is one of the most important tools that an astronomer has for
studying the universe. This chapter begins by discussing the basics, including
the different types of optical spectrographs, with extension to the ultraviolet
and the near-infrared. Emphasis is given to the fundamentals of how
spectrographs are used, and the trade-offs involved in designing an
observational experiment. It then covers observing and reduction techniques,
noting that some of the standard practices of flat-fielding often actually
degrade the quality of the data rather than improve it. Although the focus is
on point sources, spatially resolved spectroscopy of extended sources is also
briefly discussed. Discussion of differential extinction, the impact of
crowding, multi-object techniques, optimal extractions, flat-fielding
considerations, and determining radial velocities and velocity dispersions
provide the spectroscopist with the fundamentals needed to obtain the best
data. Finally the chapter combines the previous material by providing some
examples of real-life observing experiences with several typical instruments.Comment: An abridged version of a chapter to appear in Planets, Stars and
  Stellar Systems, to be published in 2011 by Springer. Slightly revise We describe serial MR-spectroscopy studies in a patient with systemic lupus erythematosus and headache. We used MR-spectroscopy to monitor disease activity during periods with and without headache. MR-spectroscopy investigates metabolic alterations and was used to explore the pathophysiological mechanism involved in the complications of systemic lupus erythematosus. Our patient underwent serial conventional MRI and MR-spectroscopy at times of controlled and uncontrolled headache, with or without visual aura. MR-spectroscopy showed an increase in the choline/creatine ratio in thalamus and posterior white matter only during periods of uncontrolled headache with visual aura. Conventional MRI scans were normal at all times. MR-spectroscopy should be used in the diagnosis and follow-up of headache in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus N/ The measurement of isotopic ratios provides a privileged insight both into
nucleosynthesis and into the mechanisms operating in stellar envelopes, such as
gravitational settling. In this article, we give a few examples of how isotopic
ratios can be determined from high-resolution, high-quality stellar spectra. We
consider examples of the lightest elements, H and He, for which the isotopic
shifts are very large and easily measurable, and examples of heavier elements
for which the determination of isotopic ratios is more difficult. The presence
of 6Li in the stellar atmospheres causes a subtle extra depression in the red
wing of the 7Li 670.7 nm doublet which can only be detected in spectra of the
highest quality. But even with the best spectra, the derived $^6$Li abundance
can only be as good as the synthetic spectra used for their interpretation. It
is now known that 3D non-LTE modelling of the lithium spectral line profiles is
necessary to account properly for the intrinsic line asymmetry, which is
produced by convective flows in the atmospheres of cool stars, and can mimic
the presence of 6Li. We also discuss briefly the case of the carbon isotopic
ratio in metal-poor stars, and provide a new determination of the nickel
isotopic ratios in the solar atmosphere.Comment: AIP Thinkshop 10 ""High resolution optical spectroscopy"", invited

9b6de068-280c-4ff0-9fe8-474c783a7b22	femme fatale	"Film noir stereotypes female characters through the archetype of the femme fatale: the fatal woman or the fatal wife. However, critics are currently re-examining the femme fatale. For example, in the second paragraph of Film Noir’s Progressive Portrayal of Women, Stephanie Blaser and John Blaser write “even when [film noir] depicts women as dangerous and worthy of destruction, [it] also shows that women are confined by the roles traditionally open to them.” With Blaser and Blaser’s understanding of the double nature of the femme fatale in mind, can one say that the femme fatale generates fear of feminism? Can one read her as a martyr and a heroine? I will examine facets of the femme fatale in modern and classic iterations, while contextualizing women’s historical roles in society.
Historically, the femme fatale originated as a response to World War II. As Gary Morris notes in the last paragraph of “High Gallows: Revisiting Jacques Tourneur’s Out of the Past,” “[she] embodies post-war fears that women, having contributed mightily to the war effort and moved into ‘men’s work,’ might abandon the domestic sphere entirely... and even the most powerful men around her can’t comprehend or control the violent forces she represents.” Additionally, the essay will focus on Phyllis in Billy Wilder’s Double Indemnity, Kathie in Jacques Tourneur’s Out of the Past, and Evelyn in Roman Polanski’s Chinatown. To include a literary dimension, I will also provide a close reading of Velma in Farewell, My Lovely by Raymond Chandler.  To comprehend the femme fatale and her relationship to women’s roles in Western society, these women must be placed in a broader, historical spectrum. Transhistorical examination of the femme fatale will be achieved by examining one of the most prominent characters in Judeo-Christian society, Eve. The close reading of this proto-femme fatale will specifically examine her role in Genesis and Milton’s Paradise Lost. Closely reading the femme fatale is important because it contextualizes modern women’s roles, both locally and globally, and aids in the drive towards gender equality This thesis examines how contemporary femme fatales operate under patriarchal notions and expectations of gender and femininity to get away with their crimes. Whereas classic femme fatales were relegated to a tragic fate—either through death, incarceration or other forms of subjugation—contemporary femme fatales now have the narrative possibility of using their sexuality, intellect and agency to get away with their crimes at the expense of the male hero. Breaking with the traditional analysis centering around the femme fatale in her relation to men and male anxieties regarding feminine sexual difference, I propose a queer reading of the contemporary femme fatale that accredits the femme fatale for her active cunning and independence through an examination of her enhanced characteristics which make it possible for her to succeed under the continuous constraints of the patriarchy. The films examined are: The Last Seduction (1994), Gone Girl (2014), Body Heat (1981), Nightmare Alley (2021), Bound (1996) and Basic Instinct (1992). While the popularity of the femme fatale continues, there are still relatively few examples of femme fatales who get away with their crimes as well as a continued lack of scholarship that discusses the intricacies of the femme fatale absent from her theorization as a beacon of male anxieties. However, this project remains hopeful and advocates for a more diverse representation and an in increase scholastic conversation surrounding femme fatales in contemporary cinema This thesis offers a reappraisal of the recurring figure of the femme fatale within Decadent art

and literature of the nineteenth century. Despite the ubiquity of studies concerning the femme

fatale, most notably within genres such as Film Noir and Romanticism, the Decadent femme

fatale has often been relegated to a single chapter or footnote within these studies. It is here the

purpose of this thesis to rectify this critical disregard.

Combining multiple disciplines (literature, aesthetics, history, mythology and

psychology) each of the four chapters of this thesis will locate the femme fatale within

nineteenth-century European Decadent texts as represented as a specific objet d’art: the

haunted portrait, the corpse-doll, the fragmented sculpture, and the mutilated and/or sculpted

body of the androgyne. Invoking Harold Bloom’s theory of the anxiety of influence, the

influence and trajectory of each chapter’s respective femme fatale will be traced from the midnineteenth century through to the fin de siècle. By tracing the lineage of the aesthetic impression

made by French Decadent writers of the mid-nineteenth century (such as Théophile Gautier

and Charles Baudelaire) upon subsequent French and British writers and artists of the latenineteenth century (such as Dante Gabriel Rossetti, Algernon Charles Swinburne, Walter Pater,

Rachilde, and Vernon Lee), this thesis interrogates how the re/construction and usage of the

Decadent femme fatale was utilized as a means of exploring ulterior philosophies of classical

beauty and a fluid range of forbidden sexualities, including androgyny and homoeroticism.

Offering interdisciplinary readings of the nineteenth-century Decadent femme fatale,

this thesis shows the different ways in which nineteenth-century Decadent writers and artists

move beyond the femme fatale’s malevolence, though without losing sight of it, to explore the

mysterious relationships between life and death, art and artifice, pleasure and pain, and the seen

and unseen openThe thesis starts by giving a general definition of femme fatale and by talking about women’s role during the Nineteenth century, myth and mythological creatures. It then moves towards the femme fatale in romantic poetry, analysing selected poems of John Keats and Percy Bysshe Shelley. Finally, it discusses the fatal woman in victorian poetry with selected poems of Dante Gabriel Rossetti The femme fatale, a quasi-eternal figure of female transgression and retributory violence, has gradually entered popular culture’s symbolic lexicon as representative of mainstream feminism and postmodern femininity. Tracing the development of the femme fatale into a feminist pop culture icon necessitates establishing her sociopolitical status in the late modern era through her presence in Victorian sensational literature. The femme’s translation from the Victorian context to the American mediascape presages her evolving presence in three cinematic eras: classic film noir, neo-conservative retro noir, and millennial neo-noir. Feminist film criticism tends to identify the femme fatale as a protofeminist, a productive transgressor of social norms whose worth has only been posteriorly discovered. In opposition to this reading, I propose that the femme’s transgressive, exploitive, and consumerist character has been designed by a media industry eager to retain cathartically satiated female consumers. While traditional noir narratives repair the femme’s social rupture through her death or punishment, post-classic noirs respond to feminist approval by celebrating and prolonging the femme’s extralegal power. This incremental narrative change shows the femme emerging as not only an acceptable model for female social behavior, but a dominant ideal in the postfeminist age, one paradoxically supported by the very system it purports to dismantle. Her transgressive status claims a modicum of effectiveness and authenticity during her deployment in Victorian and post-war texts, when existing barricades to female agency rationalize the figure’s desperate methods. However, as gender politics advance and the femme fatale continues to revenge herself against a bygone world order, the figure begins to bear witness to a problematic nostalgia within feminism for the galvanizing effects of oppression. The continued conflation of the femme’s selfishness and destructivity with social restructure requires contemporary texts to theatrically reinvigorate a paradigm of oppression equal to her crimes. The issue at stake in the popularity of this conflict-based feminism lies in how the postmodern femme fatale makes superficial progress toward female ascendency but comprehends an underlying regression toward female subordination This project seeks to explore female monstrosity, specifically the femme fatale, in Gothic literature and its reflection of the shifting gender norms of the nineteenth century. The late 1790s experienced a distinct narrowing of female gender roles. While authors like Mary Wollstonecraft and Mary Hays publish during the eighteenth century, a backlash against such feminist voices took hold as a resurgence of spheres ideology and more traditional gender norms came into vogue. This particular shift in attitudes towards female gender norms is reflected in Scottish poet Anne Bannerman’s work as well as English novelist Charlotte Dacre’s Zofloya. Both authors’s works exhibit early inquiries into female gender roles and express anxiety about the negative impact they had upon society as a whole. Their femme fatales demonstrate the contradictory and destructive nature of gender roles at the beginning of the nineteenth century, but neither author appears able to articulate any solution to those issues. Bram Stoker’s Dracula at the close of the nineteenth century utilizes the same femme fatale trope, yet Mina Harker exhibits more constructive capabilities than her terrifying predecessors This paper analyses the femme fatale archetype and its representations in literature and movies. Its aim is to explore whether they represent feminist heroes who changed the traditional roles of women in society or whether they are stereotypical characters represented as male fantasies objectified into sex symbols based on the prejudices and injustices of patriarchal society. The femme fatale archetype is analysed in 1862 Mary Elizabeth Braddon’s novel Lady Audley’s Secret, 1940 Raymond Chandler’s novel Farewell, My Lovely, 1961 Blake Edwards’ movie Breakfast at Tiffany’s and 1992 Paul Verhoeven’s movie Basic Instinct. The theoretical framework of the paper explores the influence that feminism and feminist literary criticism had on the shaping of the femme fatale character and it also explores the feminist point of view on the character and its representations in literature and movies. The main part of the paper analyses the femme fatale archetype in the mentioned novels and movies and its relationship with other male and female characters. It explores the way these women challenged the existing patriarchal system and how they were punished for their unconventional behaviour. If they succeeded in refusing to play the traditional women’s role, they were given the most negative characteristics. In addition, it also analyses the noir genre in which this archetype is most frequently present and the influence the World Wars had on shaping this genre and the femme fatale In The Contemporary Femme Fatale: Gender, Genre and American Cinema, Katherine Farrimond shows how the femme fatale - primarily associated with the classic film noirs of the 1940s and 1950s – remains a remarkably resilient and malleable figure in the present, tracing her appearance across a variety of genres in contemporary US cinema. This is a well-argued, convincing study, writes Fiona Handyside, with a reading of the femme fatale that demonstrates her capacity to pose vital and complex questions about the representation of women’s agency, sexuality and desire in the current cultural landscape Die Femme fatale ist ein komplexes Thema, welches in dieser Arbeit versucht wurde fassbar zu machen.

We measured overall social media use, nighttime-specific social media use, emotional investment in social media, sleep quality, self-esteem and levels of anxiety and depression. Adolescents who used social media more – both overall and at night – and those who were more emotionally invested in social media experienced poorer sleep quality, lower self-esteem and higher levels of anxiety and depression. Nighttime-specific social media use predicted poorer sleep quality after controlling for anxiety, depression and self-esteem. These findings contribute to the growing body of evidence that social media use is related to various aspects of wellbeing in adolescents. In addition, our results indicate that nighttime-specific social media use and emotional investment in social media are two important factors that merit further investigation in relation to adolescent sleep and wellbeing Purpose-The study complements the scant macroeconomic literature on the development outcomes of social media by examining the relationship between Facebook penetration and violent crime levels in a cross-section of 148 countries for the year 2012. 



Design/methodology/approach-The empirical evidence is based on Ordinary Least Squares (OLS), Tobit and Quantile regressions. In order to respond to policy concerns on the limited evidence on the consequences of social media in developing countries, the dataset is disaggregated into regions and income levels. The decomposition by income levels included: low income, lower middle income, upper middle income and high income. The corresponding regions include: Europe and Central Asia, East Asia and the Pacific, Middle East and North Africa, Sub-Saharan Africa and Latin America.



Findings-From OLS and Tobit regressions, there is a negative relationship between Facebook penetration and crime. However, Quantile regressions reveal that the established negative relationship is noticeable exclusively in the 90th crime decile. Further, when the dataset is decomposed into regions and income levels, the negative relationship is evident in the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) while a positive relationship is confirmed for sub-Saharan Africa. Policy implications are discussed.





Originality/value- Studies on the development outcomes of social media are sparse because of a lack of reliable macroeconomic data on social media. This study primarily complemented three existing studies that have leveraged on a newly available dataset on Facebook The process of socialization for new and future journalists will look dramatically different from the process undergone by previous generations of journalists, due to economic realities and changes in the nature of news production. The rise of social media and its role in the establishment of a successful career will also affect the integration of these rising professionals into their employing organizations. These changes in the socialization process will require alterations both in the day-to-day management of these individuals and in the theoretical approaches to studying their work, particularly with regard to the impact of social media on the profession. This paper demonstrates a wide range of concerns that media managers and researchers must consider as the journalism profession incorporates these new professionals into its ranks Judicial failure to recognize social media\u27s influence on juror decision making has identifiable constitutional implications. The Sixth Amendment right to a fair trial demands that courts grant a defendant\u27s change of venue motion when media-generated pretrial publicity invades the unbiased sensibility of those who are asked to sit in judgment. Courts limit publicity suitable for granting a defendant\u27s motion to information culled from newspapers, radio, and television reports. Since about 2014, however, a handful of defendants have introduced social media posts to support their claims of unconstitutional bias in the community. Despite defendants\u27 introduction of negative social media in support of their claims, these same courts have yet to include social media in their evaluation of pretrial publicity bias. But social media is media, and as this article demonstrates, trial court judges faced with deciding change of venue motions have a constitutional obligation to include social media in their evaluations.
The collective refusal to treat social media the same as biased television, radio, or print media, suggests an erroneous assumption on the part of lower courts that social media is somehow different. This article identifies three reasons as justification for dismissing social media: social media is too recent a medium to fully understand and analyze, social media is not a legitimate news source, and social media is opinion based. Application of pretrial social media publicity to long-standing Supreme Court change of venue doctrine, coupled with its exploration of scientific and social research on social media influence, debunk these lower court rationalizations.
This article demonstrates that the reluctance of courts to consider social media evidence when deciding whether to grant a motion for a change of venue is a violation of any defendant\u27s Sixth Amendment right to a fair trial. On a larger scale, the article demands that courts embrace our new reality. Social media intersects with criminal justice, and our daily lives, in ways that demand judicial recognition Measuring the impact and success of human performance is common in various
disciplines, including art, science, and sports. Quantifying impact also plays
a key role on social media, where impact is usually defined as the reach of a
user's content as captured by metrics such as the number of views, likes,
retweets, or shares. In this paper, we study entire careers of Twitter users to
understand properties of impact. We show that user impact tends to have certain
characteristics: First, impact is clustered in time, such that the most
impactful tweets of a user appear close to each other. Second, users commonly
have 'hot streaks' of impact, i.e., extended periods of high-impact tweets.
Third, impact tends to gradually build up before, and fall off after, a user's
most impactful tweet. We attempt to explain these characteristics using various
properties measured on social media, including the user's network, content,
activity, and experience, and find that changes in impact are associated with
significant changes in these properties. Our findings open interesting avenues
for future research on virality and influence on social media.Comment: Accepted as a full paper at ICWSM 2019. Please cite the ICWSM versio This guide is designed for youth project managers, and has the following aims ""To explain social media technologies and functions

To inform the discussion over free speech and hate speech, this study examines the way racial, religious and ethnic slurs are employed on Twitter.

Executive summary: How to define the limits of free speech is a central debate in most modern democracies. This is particularly difficult in relation to hateful, abusive and racist speech. The pattern of hate speech is complex. But there is increasing focus on the volume and nature of hateful or racist speech taking place online; and new modes of communication mean it is easier than ever to find and capture this type of language.

How and whether to respond to certain types of language use without curbing freedom of expression in this online space is a significant question for policy makers, civil society groups, law enforcement agencies and others. This short study aims to inform these difficult decisions by examining specifically the way racial and ethnic slurs (henceforth, ‘slurs’) are used on the popular microblogging site, Twitter.

Slurs relate specifically to a set of words, terms, or nicknames which are used to refer to groups in a society in a derogatory, pejorative or insulting manner. Slurs can be used in a hateful way, but that is not always the case. Therefore, this research is not about hate speech per se, but about epistemology and linguistics: word use and meaning.

In this study, we aim to answer two following questions:

(a) In what ways are slurs being used on Twitter, and in what volume?

(b) What is the potential for automated machine learning techniques to accurately identify and classify slurs We define social media as online or digital technologies that serve to connect people, information and organisations through networks. The term evolved as a way to -distinguish the emerging online -information platforms from traditional ""broadcast media"" -- TV, radio, film, newspapers -- by highlighting that these new tools -were ""socialised"" and allowed the audiences to contribute to their content. Social media have therefore become defined in relation to these existing media channels, but in fact they have their ancestry in existing social technologies, like the telephone and the letter.

8018c76d-0178-41dd-b9fb-29b9b147eb2a	global burden of disease study	"Background: Rigorous analysis of levels and trends in exposure to leading risk factors and quantification of their effect on human health are important to identify where public health is making progress and in which cases current efforts are inadequate. The Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors Study (GBD) 2019 provides a standardised and comprehensive assessment of the magnitude of risk factor exposure, relative risk, and attributable burden of disease. Methods: GBD 2019 estimated attributable mortality, years of life lost (YLLs), years of life lived with disability (YLDs), and disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs) for 87 risk factors and combinations of risk factors, at the global level, regionally, and for 204 countries and territories. GBD uses a hierarchical list of risk factors so that specific risk factors (eg, sodium intake), and related aggregates (eg, diet quality), are both evaluated. This method has six analytical steps. (1) We included 560 riskâ��outcome pairs that met criteria for convincing or probable evidence on the basis of research studies. 12 riskâ��outcome pairs included in GBD 2017 no longer met inclusion criteria and 47 riskâ��outcome pairs for risks already included in GBD 2017 were added based on new evidence. (2) Relative risks were estimated as a function of exposure based on published systematic reviews, 81 systematic reviews done for GBD 2019, and meta-regression. (3) Levels of exposure in each age-sex-location-year included in the study were estimated based on all available data sources using spatiotemporal Gaussian process regression, DisMod-MR 2.1, a Bayesian meta-regression method, or alternative methods. (4) We determined, from published trials or cohort studies, the level of exposure associated with minimum risk, called the theoretical minimum risk exposure level. (5) Attributable deaths, YLLs, YLDs, and DALYs were computed by multiplying population attributable fractions (PAFs) by the relevant outcome quantity for each age-sex-location-year. (6) PAFs and attributable burden for combinations of risk factors were estimated taking into account mediation of different risk factors through other risk factors. Across all six analytical steps, 30 652 distinct data sources were used in the analysis. Uncertainty in each step of the analysis was propagated into the final estimates of attributable burden. Exposure levels for dichotomous, polytomous, and continuous risk factors were summarised with use of the summary exposure value to facilitate comparisons over time, across location, and across risks. Because the entire time series from 1990 to 2019 has been re-estimated with use of consistent data and methods, these results supersede previously published GBD estimates of attributable burden. Findings: The largest declines in risk exposure from 2010 to 2019 were among a set of risks that are strongly linked to social and economic development, including household air pollution; unsafe water, sanitation, and handwashing; and child growth failure. Global declines also occurred for tobacco smoking and lead exposure. The largest increases in risk exposure were for ambient particulate matter pollution, drug use, high fasting plasma glucose, and high body-mass index. In 2019, the leading Level 2 risk factor globally for attributable deaths was high systolic blood pressure, which accounted for 10Â·8 million (95 uncertainty interval UI 9Â·51â��12Â·1) deaths (19Â·2% 16Â·9â��21Â·3 of all deaths in 2019), followed by tobacco (smoked, second-hand, and chewing), which accounted for 8Â·71 million (8Â·12â��9Â·31) deaths (15Â·4% 14Â·6â��16Â·2 of all deaths in 2019). The leading Level 2 risk factor for attributable DALYs globally in 2019 was child and maternal malnutrition, which largely affects health in the youngest age groups and accounted for 295 million (253â��350) DALYs (11Â·6% 10Â·3â��13Â·1 of all global DALYs that year). The risk factor burden varied considerably in 2019 between age groups and locations. Among children aged 0â��9 years, the three leading detailed risk factors for attributable DALYs were all related to malnutrition. Iron deficiency was the leading risk factor for those aged 10â��24 years, alcohol use for those aged 25â��49 years, and high systolic blood pressure for those aged 50â��74 years and 75 years and older. Interpretation: Overall, the record for reducing exposure to harmful risks over the past three decades is poor. Success with reducing smoking and lead exposure through regulatory policy might point the way for a stronger role for public policy on other risks in addition to continued efforts to provide information on risk factor harm to the general public.

This is an Open Access article under the CC BY 4.0 licens Background: Uncorrected refractive error (URE) is a readily treatable cause of visual impairment (VI). This study provides updated estimates of global and regional vision loss due to URE, presenting temporal change for VISION 2020 Methods: Data from population-based eye disease surveys from 1980–2018 were collected. Hierarchical models estimated prevalence (95% uncertainty intervals [UI]) of blindness (presenting visual acuity (VA) < 3/60) and moderate-to-severe vision impairment (MSVI; 3/60 ≤ presenting VA < 6/18) caused by URE, stratified by age, sex, region, and year. Near VI prevalence from uncorrected presbyopia was defined as presenting near VA < N6/N8 at 40 cm when best-corrected distance (VA ≥ 6/12). Results: In 2020, 3.7 million people (95%UI 3.10–4.29) were blind and 157 million (140–176) had MSVI due to URE, a 21.8% increase in blindness and 72.0% increase in MSVI since 2000. Age-standardised prevalence of URE blindness and MSVI decreased by 30.5% (30.7–30.3) and 2.4% (2.6–2.2) respectively during this time. In 2020, South Asia GBD super-region had the highest 50+ years age-standardised URE blindness (0.33% (0.26–0.40%)) and MSVI (10.3% (8.82–12.10%)) rates. The age-standardized ratio of women to men for URE blindness was 1.05:1.00 in 2020 and 1.03:1.00 in 2000. An estimated 419 million (295–562) people 50+ had near VI from uncorrected presbyopia, a +75.3% (74.6–76.0) increase from 2000 Conclusions: The number of cases of VI from URE substantively grew, even as age-standardised prevalence fell, since 2000, with a continued disproportionate burden by region and sex. Global population ageing will increase this burden, highlighting urgent need for novel approaches to refractive service delivery BACKGROUND: Many causes of vision impairment can be prevented or treated. With an ageing global population, the demands for eye health services are increasing. We estimated the prevalence and relative contribution of avoidable causes of blindness and vision impairment globally from 1990 to 2020. We aimed to compare the results with the World Health Assembly Global Action Plan (WHA GAP) target of a 25% global reduction from 2010 to 2019 in avoidable vision impairment, defined as cataract and undercorrected refractive error.



METHODS: We did a systematic review and meta-analysis of population-based surveys of eye disease from January, 1980, to October, 2018. We fitted hierarchical models to estimate prevalence (with 95% uncertainty intervals [UIs]) of moderate and severe vision impairment (MSVI; presenting visual acuity from <6/18 to 3/60) and blindness (<3/60 or less than 10° visual field around central fixation) by cause, age, region, and year. Because of data sparsity at younger ages, our analysis focused on adults aged 50 years and older.



FINDINGS: Global crude prevalence of avoidable vision impairment and blindness in adults aged 50 years and older did not change between 2010 and 2019 (percentage change -0·2% [95% UI -1·5 to 1·0]; 2019 prevalence 9·58 cases per 1000 people [95% IU 8·51 to 10·8], 2010 prevalence 96·0 cases per 1000 people [86·0 to 107·0]). Age-standardised prevalence of avoidable blindness decreased by -15·4% [-16·8 to -14·3], while avoidable MSVI showed no change (0·5% [-0·8 to 1·6]). However, the number of cases increased for both avoidable blindness (10·8% [8·9 to 12·4]) and MSVI (31·5% [30·0 to 33·1]). The leading global causes of blindness in those aged 50 years and older in 2020 were cataract (15·2 million cases [9% IU 12·7-18·0]), followed by glaucoma (3·6 million cases [2·8-4·4]), undercorrected refractive error (2·3 million cases [1·8-2·8]), age-related macular degeneration (1·8 million cases [1·3-2·4]), and diabetic retinopathy (0·86 million cases [0·59-1·23]). Leading causes of MSVI were undercorrected refractive error (86·1 million cases [74·2-101·0]) and cataract (78·8 million cases [67·2-91·4]).



INTERPRETATION: Results suggest eye care services contributed to the observed reduction of age-standardised rates of avoidable blindness but not of MSVI, and that the target in an ageing global population was not reached.



FUNDING: Brien Holden Vision Institute, Fondation Théa, The Fred Hollows Foundation, Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, Lions Clubs International Foundation, Sightsavers International, and University of Heidelberg Major depressive disorder (MDD) is a severe psychiatric syndrome with very-high socioeconomic impact worldwide (Global Burden of Disease Study 2013 Collaborators, 2015). This is attributable to three main factors: (i) MDD is a highly prevalent disorder in the general population, (ii) depressive episodes have long duration and occur during active periods of adult life, resulting in very large labor costs, and (iii) standard MDD treatments have limited efficacy, leaving a high percentage of patients with incomplete responses and poor quality of life, thus increasing suicide risk (Rush et al, 2006).Peer reviewe OBJECTIVES: This study provides an overview of the influence of occupational risk factors on the global burden of disease as estimated by the occupational component of the Global Burden of Disease (GBD) 2016 study. METHODS: The GBD 2016 study estimated the burden in terms of deaths and disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) arising from the effects of occupational risk factors (carcinogens; asthmagens; particulate matter, gases and fumes (PMGF); secondhand smoke (SHS); noise; ergonomic risk factors for low back pain; risk factors for injury). A population attributable fraction (PAF) approach was used for most risk factors. RESULTS: In 2016, globally, an estimated 1.53 (95% uncertainty interval 1.39-1.68) million deaths and 76.1 (66.3-86.3) million DALYs were attributable to the included occupational risk factors, accounting for 2.8% of deaths and 3.2% of DALYs from all causes. Most deaths were attributable to PMGF, carcinogens (particularly asbestos), injury risk factors and SHS. Most DALYs were attributable to injury risk factors and ergonomic exposures. Men and persons 55 years or older were most affected. PAFs ranged from 26.8% for low back pain from ergonomic risk factors and 19.6% for hearing loss from noise to 3.4% for carcinogens. DALYs per capita were highest in Oceania, Southeast Asia and Central sub-Saharan Africa. On a per capita basis, between 1990 and 2016 there was an overall decrease of about 31% in deaths and 25% in DALYs. CONCLUSIONS: Occupational exposures continue to cause an important health burden worldwide, justifying the need for ongoing prevention and control initiatives Background: We aimed to update estimates of global vision loss due to age-related macular degeneration (AMD). Methods: We did a systematic review and meta-analysis of population-based surveys of eye diseases from January, 1980, to October, 2018. We fitted hierarchical models to estimate the prevalence of moderate and severe vision impairment (MSVI; presenting visual acuity from <6/18 to 3/60) and blindness (< 3/60) caused by AMD, stratified by age, region, and year. Results: In 2020, 1.85 million (95%UI: 1.35 to 2.43 million) people were estimated to be blind due to AMD, and another 6.23 million (95%UI: 5.04 to 7.58) with MSVI globally. High-income countries had the highest number of individuals with AMD-related blindness (0.60 million people; 0.46 to 0.77). The crude prevalence of AMD-related blindness in 2020 (among those aged ≥ 50 years) was 0.10% (0.07 to 0.12) globally, and the region with the highest prevalence of AMD-related blindness was North Africa/Middle East (0.22%; 0.16 to 0.30). Age-standardized prevalence (using the GBD 2019 data) of AMD-related MSVI in people aged ≥ 50 years in 2020 was 0.34% (0.27 to 0.41) globally, and the region with the highest prevalence of AMD-related MSVI was also North Africa/Middle East (0.55%; 0.44 to 0.68). From 2000 to 2020, the estimated crude prevalence of AMD-related blindness decreased globally by 19.29%, while the prevalence of MSVI increased by 10.08%. Conclusions: The estimated increase in the number of individuals with AMD-related blindness and MSVI globally urges the creation of novel treatment modalities and the expansion of rehabilitation

él, la responsabilidad social. El desarrollo humano sostenible es un concepto que cada
vez está teniendo más predicamento en los debates acerca del cambio climático y sus
consecuencias y en las cumbres sobre cooperación internacional: el motivo de que ello
ocurra es que aúna las dos dimensiones que, como intentaré mostrar son
complementarias. Presenta para ello el desarrollo entendido en términos de justicia: la
vida digna hoy de todos y la vida digna de los que vengan mañana. Enmarcado dentro
de la búsqueda de un desarrollo humano sostenible quiero mostrar en este trabajo cómo
la responsabilidad social de las organizaciones es una forma de acción concreta y viable
para contribuir a este tipo de desarrollo.Departamento de Filosofía (Filosofía, Lógica y Filosofía de la Ciencia, Teoría e Historia de la Educación, Filosofía Moral, Estética y Teoría de las Artes)Grado en Filosofí La estructura se divide en:
1. Las Metas Nacionales con tres secciones:
Sección I. Información sobre las metas que se procura alcanzar a nivel nacional.
Sección II. Medidas de implementación adoptadas, evaluación de su eficacia, obstáculos relacionados y necesidades científicas y técnicas para alcanzar las metas nacionales.
Sección III. Evaluación de los progresos logrados para alcanzar cada meta nacional
2. Contribución al logro de las Metas Aichi
3. Contribución para alcanzan los Objetivos de Desarrollo Sostenible
4. Perfil del paí El Marco de Asociación País entre República Dominicana y España para el período 2019-2022 establece los resultados de desarrollo a los que la Cooperación Española contribuirá durante ese tiempo, además de establecer los instrumentos principales para ello. Así, los objetivos establecidos se centrarán en lograr el fortalecimiento del Estado de Derecho promoviendo instituciones eficaces y transparentes; la promoción de la igualdad de género y la eliminación de todas las formas de violencia de género; la reducción de la inequidad socioeconómica y territorial, promoviendo el acceso a oportunidades para los sectores más vulnerables El Marco de Asociación País entre República Dominicana y España para el período 2019-2022 establece los resultados de desarrollo a los que la Cooperación Española contribuirá durante ese tiempo, además de establecer los instrumentos principales para ello.

Hydrogen peroxide has been used medically for almost a century, but its applications in orthopaedic surgery have yet to be fully determined. The basic science and clinical research on the antiseptic efficacy of hydrogen peroxide have demonstrated its efficacy against bacteria, and it has demonstrated potential synergy with other irrigation solutions such as chlorhexidine and povidone-iodine. While hydrogen peroxide is effective in infection reduction, there are concerns with wound healing, cytotoxicity, and embolic phenomena, and we recommend against hydrogen peroxide usage in the treatment of partial knee replacements, hemiarthroplasties, or native joints. Additionally, due to the potential for oxygen gas formation, hydrogen peroxide should not be used in cases of dural compromise, when pressurizing medullary canals, or when irrigating smaller closed spaces to avoid the possibility of air embolism. Finally, we present our protocol for irrigation and debridement and exchange of modular components in total joint arthroplasty, incorporating hydrogen peroxide in combination with povidone-iodine and chlorhexidine Purpose of review: surgical site infection (SSI) is a common health care associated infection and complicates up to 10-20% of operations with considerable health care resources. Apart from the widely adopted use of appropriate hair removal, antibiotic prophylaxis, avoidance of hypothermia and peri-operative glycaemic control to reduce SSIs this review has considered new research and systematic reviews, and whether their findings should be included in guidelines.

Recent findings: The efficacy of preoperative bathing/showering, antibiotic prophylaxis for clean surgery and perioperative oxygen supplementation to reduce the risk of SSI is still in doubt. By contrast, the use of 2% chlorhexidine in alcohol skin preparation, postoperative negative pressure wound therapy and antiseptic surgical dressings do show promise. Antimicrobial sutures in independent meta-analyses were found to reduce the risk of SSI after all classes of surgery (except dirty) whereas the use of wound guards, or diathermy skin incision (compared with scalpel incision), did not.  

Summary: The incidence of SSI after surgery is not falling. Based on this review of published trials and evidence-based systematic reviews some advances might be included into these care bundles.  More research is needed together with improved compliance with care bundles Factors other than antimicrobial activity of soaps and antiseptic agents used for hand hygiene by health personnel play a role in compliance with recommendations. Hand hygiene products differ considerably in acceptance by hospital personnel. If switching from a nonmedicated soap to an antiseptic agent or increased use of an existing antiseptic agent for hand hygiene prevented a few more infections per year, additional expenditures for antiseptic agents would be offset by cost savings Ziziphus spina-christi L. or Jujube, is a plant that has many health benefits, containing metabolite compounds that act as an antibacterial agent such as alkaloids, flavonoids, saponins, tannins, and polyphenols. This study aimed to make a natural antiseptic liquid from Ziziphus spina-christi L. leaf extract used in Islamic Bathing Procedures for a corpse. The stages of this research included extraction, an assay of the extract’s antiseptic activity using the agar well diffusion method, formulating the antiseptic liquid, evaluating the antiseptic liquid, and examining the antiseptic properties of the liquid. Jujube leaf extract with a concentration of 10% was proven to have the best antibiotic properties with a very strong inhibition zone category. Antiseptic liquid formulations include extracts, DMDM hydantoin, Triethanolamine, and Aqua rose. The organoleptic evaluation results of liquid antiseptic were in the form of a homogeneous concentrate liquid, brown with a rose aroma, pH 9.048, the density of 1.020 g/mL, viscosity of 5.60 m.Pas, and 0.7 cm high foam with high foam stability of 83.33%. The antiseptic test results showed that the antiseptic solution was able to inhibit the growth of Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus epidermidis, and Candida albicans ranging from strong to very strong inhibition zone diameters, 17.35 mm, 21.10 mm, and 19.95 mm, respectively.

More alarming is the concomitant increase in antibiotic resistance that has been described for some pathogens. Unfortunately, effects of adaptation and cross-adaptation are hardly known for oral pathogens, which are very frequently exposed to antiseptics. Therefore, this study aimed to determine the in vitro increase in minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) in oral pathogens after repeated exposure to chlorhexidine or cetylpyridinium chloride, to examine if (cross-)adaptation to antiseptics/antibiotics occurs, if (cross-)adaptation is reversible and what the potential underlying mechanisms are. When the pathogens were exposed to antiseptics, their MICs significantly increased. This increase was in general at least partially conserved after regrowth without antiseptics. Some of the adapted species also showed cross-adaptation, as shown by increased MICs of antibiotics and the other antiseptic. In most antiseptic-adapted bacteria, cell-surface hydrophobicity was increased and mass-spectrometry analysis revealed changes in expression of proteins involved in a wide range of functional domains. These in vitro data shows the adaptation and cross-adaptation of oral pathogens to antiseptics and antibiotics. This was related to changes in cell surface hydrophobicity and in expression of proteins involved in membrane transport, virulence, oxidative stress protection and metabolism Bloodstain found at the crime scene can be one of the evidences of criminal action. To diminish the evidences and traces, the criminal might clean and erase the bloodstain by using alcohol based antiseptic handsanitizer which often used by people in daily life. The bloodstain which is contaminated by the alcohol-based antiseptic handsanitizer could possibly affect the result of a bloodstain examination by using the Teichmann test and the Takayama test. This research had been done to observe the image of hemoglobin crystals on bloodstains that are exposed to alcohol-based antiseptic handsanitizers by using the Teichmann and Takayama test. In this research there are 5 types of alcohol-based antiseptic handsanitizer brands swabbed on to bloodstained slides for each test. The result shown on 22 slides (100%) had positive result. This conclude the hemoglobin crystals could still be found on bloodstains which exposed to alcohol-based antiseptic handsanitizer"	['85864325', '8364301', '3673914', '138245006', '134964267', '136066013']	[[{'name': 'Hansen, Erik Nathan'}, {'name': 'Lu, Min'}], [{'name': 'Astagneau'}, {'name': 'Bayat'}, {'name': 'Blackham'}, {'name': 'Bonds'}, {'name': 'Bunn'}, {'name': 'Cabaluna'}, {'name': 'Daoud'}, {'name': 'Darouiche'}, {'name': 'Edmiston'}, {'name': 'Fry'}, {'name': 'Gheorghe'}, {'name': 'Grauhan'}, {'name': 'Jakobsson'}, {'name': 'Kamel'}, {'name': 'Kent'}, {'name': 'Kirby'}, {'name': 'Krieger'}, {'name': 'Leaper'}, {'name': 'Leaper'}, {'name': 'Leaper'}, {'name': 'Leaper'}, {'name': 'Leaper'}, {'name': 'Leaper'}, {'name': 'Lyytikainen'}, {'name': 'Matatov'}, {'name': 'Melling'}, {'name': 'Pauli'}, {'name': 'Pinkney'}, {'name': 'Richet'}, {'name': 'Sanchez-Manuel'}, {'name': 'Stannard'}, {'name': 'Strecker'}, {'name': 'Tanner'}, {'name': 'Tanner'}, {'name': 'Taylor'}, {'name': 'Thibon'}, {'name': 'Togioka'}, {'name': 'Turtiainen'}, {'name': 'Ubbink'}, {'name': 'Wang'}, {'name': 'Webster'}, {'name': 'Williams'}, {'name': 'Yokoe'}], [{'name': 'Boyce, J.

thermal stabilization Gumiranje čeličnog i tekstilnog korda predstavlja jednu od ključnih tehnologija procesiranja gume u proizvodnji auto guma. Tokom ovog procesa koji se izvodi na kalandrima izuzetno je teško ostvariti i držati konstantnom debljinu platna. Najnoviji razvoj optoelektronike i izvedenih senzorskih sistema omogućio je da se tradicionalni radioaktivni sistemi za merenje debljine gumiranog korda na linijama za kalandriranje zamene laserskim proksimetrima. Pored aposolutne bezbednosti u radu, laserski proksimetri poseduju vrhunsku tačnost, veliku brzinu uzorkovanja i ekstremno malu prostornu rezoluciju. Ova svojstva omogućuju gradnju mernih stanica, koje pored merenja debljine, omogućuju skeniranje poprečnog preseka obezbeđujući na taj način informacije o hrapavosti, teksturi i sveukupnoj valovitosti skeniranog profila. Informacija o valovitosti i teksturi može se iskoristiti za identifikaciju tehnoloških parametara režima procesa kalandriranja, što omogućava njegovo upravljanje i optimizaciju u realnom vremenu.Steel and textile cord coating is one of the key rubber processing technologies in tire making industry. It is carried out on calendaring lines where thickness variation across the sheet profile and downstream is very difficult to fulfill. Recent development of optoelectronics and derived sensory systems has enabled the replacement of traditional radioactive systems for measurement of calendared rubber thickness at calendaring lines by laser proximeters. Besides absolute work safety, laser proximeters have extreme accuracy, high sampling rate and small spatial resolution. These properties enable development of measuring systems, which besides thickness measurement enable lateral section scanning thus giving information on scanned profile roughness, overall waviness and texture. Information about profile waviness and texture can be used for identification of calendaring process parameters, which enable real-time control and optimization of this process. This paper gives a new conceptual approach for identification of surface structure calendaring process parameters based on multiresolution analysis of scanned lateral profile of rubberized cord This work aims to describe and predict the complex mechanical behavior of polymeric cords used as reinforcements in tires. Starting from the observed microstructure of the cords and from macroscopic experimental tests performed on single-ply yarns, a comprehensive geometric and mechanical model is developed. The real geometry of the cord is replaced by an equivalent three-dimensional continuum of a cylindrical shape, with a properly defined non-isotropic inelastic constitutive behavior. The three-dimensional viscoelastic and viscoplastic material model developed by the authors for rayon fibers is employed for this purpose. The actual directions of filaments inside the cord are computed by an analytical model, accounting for the twist in the yarns and in the filaments inside each yarn. Such directions, relevant to points of the cord cross-section, are then averaged along the pitch of the cord to obtain mean directions which represent the virtual reinforcement directions to be used in the equivalent cylindrical-shaped model. This analysis strategy is implemented in a finite element procedure. For rayon cords, the developed simulation tool (fed with appropriate parameters) gives numerical results that compare well with the corresponding experimental results. This approach could be effectively utilized in the analysis of cord-reinforced rubber composites Textile materials used in automobiles have a large contribution in the production of automobile carpets, seating fabrics, side, roof, floor and door panels, safety belts, tires, airbags, air filters, fuel filters, insulation materials and so on. Whereas these materials are largely manufactured by using man-made fibers, polyester (polyethylene terephthalate [PET]) is the predominant fiber used in the manufacturing of automotive textiles. This chapter deals with the use of polyester fiber in automotive applications in different forms such as knitted, woven and nonwoven textile structures and as a component of composite structures discussing the basic properties and performance aspects of the fiber Tez (Doktora) -- İstanbul Teknik Üniversitesi, Fen Bilimleri Enstitüsü, 2017Thesis (Ph.D.) -- İstanbul Technical University, Institute of Science and Technology, 2017Kord kumaşı ile güçlendirilmiş kauçuk kompozitleri, araba ve bisiklet lastikleri, hortum, taşıyıcı bantlar gibi pek çok endüstriyel alanda kullanılmaktadır. Polar yapıdaki kord kumaşı ile polar olmayan kauçuk yüzeyler arasında iyi bir yapışmanın olması, ürünün ömrünü ve kalitesini belirleyen en önemli faktördür. Araba lastiği üretiminde kord kumaşlar (polyester, polyamit, vb.) kauçuk yüzeylere yapıştırılmak amacı ile ilk olarak rezorsinol formaldehit lateks (RFL) ile ve sonra 2-vinilpiridin-stiren-bütadien terpolimeri ile muamele edilmektedir. Bu işlem kumaşın kauçuk yüzeye, lastik üretimi için gerekli olan şekilde yapışmasını sağlamaktadır. Formaldehit kullanımı, insan sağlığı ve çevre üzerindeki yan etkilerinden dolayı pek çok ülkede yasaklanmıştır. Bazı üreticiler araba lastiği üretiminde formaldehit yerine epoksi reçine kullanımını denemişlerdir. Fakat bu yöntemin solvent bazlı oluşu, büyük miktarlarda buharlaşan solventin tesis içinde birikip herhangi bir elektrik kaçağı ile patlamalara sebep olabileceği ihtimali ile diğer bir tehlikeyi beraberinde getirmektedir. Lastik üretimindeki bu tehlikeler göz önünde tutulduğunda, formaldehit ve solvent içermeyen yeni bir sisteme ihtiyaç duyulmaktadır. Son yıllarda UV-kürleme teknolojisi, hızlı kuruma, çevre dostu olma, solvent içermeme, daha az enerji gerektirme gibi üstün özelliklerinden dolayı önemli ve popüler hale gelmiştir. UV-kürlenebilir kaplama formülasyonları, oligomer, fotobaşlatıcı ve reaktif seyreltici olmak üzere üç temel bileşenden oluşmaktadır. Proseste kullanılan reaktif seyrelticiler oligomer viskozitesini düşürmede ve son ürünün yapısal özelliklerini geliştirmede yardımcı olurlar. Oligomerler, UV ışınlarının etkisi altında parçalanan fotobaşlatıcılar varlığında polimerleşen makromoleküler yapıdaki bileşiklerdir. Epoksi akrilat (EA), polyester akrilat, poliüretan akrilat (PUA) UV-kürlenebilir kaplamalarda en çok kullanılan oligomerlerdir. UV-enerji kullanımını azaltmak ve polimerizasyon hızını arttırmak amacı ile, monoakrilat sonlu EA oligomerleri gibi UV ve termal kürlenebilen fonksiyonel grupları aynı anda bulunduran, dual-kürlenebilir oligomerlerin üretimi önem kazanmaktadır. Epoksi reçinenin bir ucunda karbon-karbon çift bağlı vinil ester grupları bulunduran EA oligomerler endüstriyel uygulamalarda, üstün yapışma ve sararmama özellikleri, esneklik, sertlik ve kimyasal dayanım özelliklerinden dolayı sıklıkla kullanılmaktadır. Kürlenen filme epoksi grubu sertlik verirken karbon-karbon ve eter bağları kimyasal dayanım sağlamaktadır. Epoksi ve bir asit arasındaki reaksiyon sonucu hidroksil grupları oluşmakta, dolayısı ile yapıştırıcının ıslanabilirlik özelliği polaritenin artması sonucu iyileşmektedir. UV-kürlenebilir PUAlar, izosiyanat grup (toluen diizosiyanat (TDI), izofron diizosiyanat (IPDI) vb.) ve hidroksil grup (2-hidroksietil metakrilat (HEMA), 2-hidroksietil akrilat (HEA) vb.) içeren iki farklı kimyasal bileşiğin reaksiyonu ile üretilirler. Oligomerdeki izosiyanat grubu sertlik ve sağlamlık özelliklerinden sorumlu iken hidroksil grupları esneklik sağlamaktadır. PUA oligomerler yüksek kimyasal dayanımları, iyi yapışma özelliği, dayanıklılık ve üstün termo-mekanik özelliklerinden dolayı tercih edilmektedir. Sunulan bu tez çalışmasının amacı, tekstil kord kumaşı ve kauçuk yüzeyler arasında iyi bir yapışma gösteren, formaldehit içermeyen yeni tipte yapıştırıcı formülasyonları geliştirmektir. Tezin ilk aşamasında, bisfenol-A tipi epoksi, farklı mol oranlarında akrilik asit (AA) ile reaksiyona sokulmuştur. Karboksil/epoksit oranı ve VPA miktarının kaplamaların termal ve yapışma özelliklerine olan etkileri incelenmiştir. Elde edilen EA oligomerler Fourier transform kızılötesi (FTIR) ve proton nükleer manyetik rezonans (1H NMR) spektrometreleri ile karakterize edilmiştir. Fotopolimerizasyonun tamamlanması, FTIR analizi ile, UV-kürlemeden sonra akrilat absorpsiyon pikinin kaybolmasını izleyerek ispatlanmıştır. Bu EA oligomerler yapıştırıcı formülasyonlarına eklenmiş ve dip-kaplama ile kord kumaş yüzeylerine uygulanmıştır. Oligomer üzerindeki doymamış grup UV ışınları ile kord kumaş üzerinde sertleştirilmiştir. EA kaplı, UV-kürlenmiş kord kumaş numunelerinin termal özellikleri termogravimetrik analiz (TGA) ve diferansiyel taramalı kalorimetre (DSC) ile incelenmiştir. Kaplama ve UV-kürleme işlemleri sonrası artan karbon miktarı ile termal kararlılık artmıştır. EA kaplama daha amorf bir yapı kazandırdığından, ham kord kumaşa göre daha düşük erime sıcaklık değerleri gözlenmiştir. Taramalı elektron mikroskobu (SEM) fotoğrafları, EA kaplamanın lif yüzeyini aglomere olmadan daha düzgün hale getirdiğini göstermiştir. UV-kürlenmiş kord kumaş yüzeyinden temas açısı ölçümleri, AA artışı ile, polyester kumaş üzerindeki oksijen atomu ve asidin hidroksil grupları arasında oluşan hidrojen bağları sonucu, daha hidrofobik bir yapının oluştuğunu ispatlamıştır. UV-kürlemeden sonra kord kumaşlar kauçuk yüzeylere yapıştırılmak üzere, iki stiren-bütadien-kauçuk (SBR) tabaka arasına konmuş, sıcaklık ve basınç uygulanarak termal olarak kürlenmiştir. Çift-kürleme işleminden sonra, oligomerin yapışma özelliğini incelemek amacı ile yapışma testi yapılmıştır. Yapışma testi sonucuna göre en yüksek yapışma kuvveti 18.0 N/cm ile karboksil/epoksit oranı 1 olduğunda elde edilmiştir. Oligomerdeki akrilat fonksiyonel gruplarının artması termal kürleme işlemi sırasında SBR’ın çift bağları ile daha çok bağlanma noktası oluşumunu sağlamıştır. Yapıştırıcı formülasyonuna, yapışmayı arttırıcı olarak VPA eklendiğinde, daha yüksek yapışma kuvveti değerleri ve fosfor gruplarının doğasından gelen güç tutuşur özelliğinden dolayı yanma dayanımlı yapılar elde edilmiştir. Ayrıca, fosforun yapısından dolayı VPA artışı, termal kararlılık ve kül oranlarının artmasını sağlamıştır. Yapıştırıcının uygulanmasından önce kord kumaşları, daha hidrofilik ve fonksiyonel özellik kazandırmak amacı ile, ECE deterjanı ile yıkanmış ve sodyum hidroksit (NaOH) ile muamele edilmiştir. En yüksek yapışma kuvveti 50.8 N/cm değeri ile % 10 VPA içeren formülasyonda elde edilmiştir. Tezin ikinci aşamasında, tekstil kordlarını kauçuğa yapıştırmak için biyo-tabanlı yapıştırıcı formülasyonları hazırlanmıştır. Diğer bitkisel yağlar ile kıyaslandığında, yeni oligomerik yapıların dizayn edilmesine olanak sağlayan, daha yüksek doymamışlık oranına sahip tung yağı (TO) biyo-kaynak olarak tercih edilmiştir. Oligomer sentezi için ilk olarak TO epokside edilmiş, sonra AA ile reaksiyona sokulmuştur. Elde edilen epokside tung yağı (ETO) ve akrillenmiş epokside tung yağı (AETO) oligomerleri, FTIR, 1H NMR spektrometreleri, termal analiz yöntemleri ile karakterize edilmiş, ve daha sonra tekstil kordları ve kauçuk yüzeyler arasında yapıştırıcı olarak uygulanmıştır. Dip-kaplamalı UV-kürlenmiş kord kumaşları temas açısı ölçümleri ile karakterize edilmiştir. Kord kumaş ve kauçuk yüzeyler arasındaki yapışma kuvveti yapışma testi ile değerlendirilmiştir. Epoksit grupların TO yapısına eklenmesi ile termo-oksidatif kararlılık artmıştır. Yapıştırıcı formülasyonundaki artan AETO miktarı ile, epokside olmuş serbest yağ asitlerinin hidrofilik yapısından dolayı, temas açısı değerleri düşmüştür. En yüksek yapışma kuvveti değerleri olan 26.0 N/cm ve 20.5 N/cm, formülasyona % 50 AETO ve % 75 VPAMETO ilaveleri ile elde edilmiştir. Tezin son aşamasında, formaldehit içermeyen çift-kürlenebilen oligomerler, TDI ve HEMA reaksiyonu ile hazırlanmış ve daha sonra elde edilen PUA oligomerler farklı reaktif seyrelticiler ile birlikte yapıştırıcı formülasyonlarında kullanılmıştır. Formülasyonlara polivinil bütiral (PVB) yapışmayı arttırıcı olarak ilave edilmiştir. Tüm oligomerler FTIR ve 1H NMR spektrometreleri ile karakterize edilmiştir. Yapıştırıcı formülasyonları kord kumaşa, kauçuğa yapıştırılmak üzere uygulanmıştır. PVB miktarı, NCO:OH mol oranı ve reaktif seyreltici türünün, kord ve kauçuk yüzeyler arasındaki yapışma kuvveti üzerine olan etkileri incelenmiştir. Dip-kaplamalı UV-kürlenmiş kord kumaşların, termal kararlılık ve erime sıcaklıkları, kaplama sonrası amorf yapıların ilavesi nedeni ile düşmüştür. PVB, güçlü bir bağlanma yeteneği vererek, kord kumaş ve kauçuk yüzeyler arasında yapışmayı arttırıcı olarak rol almıştır. Formülasyondaki PVB miktarı arttıkça yapışma kuvveti artmıştır. En yüksek yapışma kuvveti olan 94.7 N/cm değeri, formülasyona % 5 PVB ilavesi ile elde edilmiştir. Trimetilolpropan trimetakrilat (TMPTMA) ve trisiklodekan dimetanol diakrilat (TCDDA) formülasyonlarda reaktif seyreltici olarak kullanılmıştır. TCDDA’daki trisiklodekan grubunun hacimli ve halkalı yapısı, yapıştırıcı formülasyonuna, TMPTMA içeren numunelere göre daha yüksek termal kararlılık, sertlik ve daha iyi yapışma kuvveti değerleri sağlamıştır. En yüksek yapışma kuvveti olan 100.4 N/cm değeri, reaktif seyreltici olarak TCDDA kullanıldığında elde edilmiştir. Oligomerdeki NCO:OH mol oranının etkisi incelendiğinde, NCO:OH oranı arttıkça, termal kararlılık, jel fraksiyonu, camsı geçiş ve erime sıcaklıkları, yapışma kuvveti artmış, şişme derecesi ve kimyasal çözeltiye maruziyet sonucu ağırlık kaybı değerleri azalmıştır. Tüm bu sonuçlar, trimerizasyon reaksiyonları sonucu oluşan moleküller arası hidrojen bağlarının, yüksek çapraz bağlanmış, üç boyutlu, düşük moleküler hareketliliğe sahip, yüksek yapışma kuvveti gösteren yapıların oluşması ile açıklanabilir. En yüksek yapışma kuvveti olan 103 N/cm değeri, NCO:OH mol oranı 4 olduğunda elde edilmiştir. Ayrıca, TCDDA ve TMPTMA reaktif seyrelticileri farklı oranlarda karıştırılarak da yapıştırıcı formülasyonlarına eklenmiş, yapışma kuvveti incelenmiştir. Buna göre en yüksek yapışma kuvveti değeri olan 111.6 N/cm reaktif seyreltici olarak tek başına TCDDA kullanılan formülasyonda elde edilmiştir. Bu sonuç daha önce belirtildiği gibi, TCDDA içerisinde bulunan hacimli ve halkalı grupların yüzey fonksiyonelliğini arttırması sonucu kord kumaş/kauçuk arasındaki etkileşimin artmasına ile açıklanabilmektedir.Cord fabric reinforced rubber composites have been widely used in some industrial applications such as car and bicycle tires, hoses, conveyor belts etc. A good adhesion between the polar cord fabric and non-polar rubber surfaces is the most crucial factor determining the product life and quality. In tyre production process, the tyre cord (polyester, polyamide, etc.) is treated first with a resorcinol formaldehyde latex (RFL) and then with a terpolymer of 2-vinylpyridine-styrene-butadiene to adhere the cord onto the rubber surface. This treatment gives a close bonding of tyre cord to rubber essential in the production of tires. Since the formaldehyde usage causes adverse effect on human health and environment, its usage has been restricted in many countries. Some manufacturers tried to use epoxy resin as adhesive instead of formaldehyde in tyre production. Because of this process is solvent-based, another danger can be seen resulting from the accumulation of high amounts of solvent in the factory roof which can cause explosion by the effect of any electrical leakage. Considering the mentioned tyre production processes and their dangers, a new process is desired without any formaldehyde and solvent usage. UV-curing technology became so important and popular recently due to its superior properties such as instant drying, being ecofriendly and solvent-free process, requiring less energy and so on. UV-curable coating formulations consist of three basic components; oligomer, photoinitiator, and reactive diluent. The reactive diluents in the process help to lower the viscosity of the oligomer and improve the overall structural properties of the end product. Oligomers are macromolecular complexes that can be polymerized by photolysis of photoinitiators with the exposure of UV light. Epoxy acrylate (EA), polyester acrylate, polyurethane acrylate (PUA) are mostly used oligomers in UV-curable coatings. In order to reduce the UV energy and increase the polymerization rate, a dual-curable oligomer having both UV-curable and thermal-curable functional groups in one resin is desirable such as monoacrylate-terminated EA oligomers. EA oligomers having vinyl ester groups with carbon-carbon double bonds at the end of the epoxy resin, are generaly used in industrial applications because of excellent adhesive and non-yellowing properties, flexibility, hardness, and chemical resistance. The epoxy part gives toughness to the cured films whilst carbon-carbon and ether bonds give chemical resistance to the structure. The reaction between epoxy and an acid produces hydroxyl groups, thereby introducing polarity which can improve the wettability of adhesive. UV-curable PUAs are formed by the reaction of two chemical species containing an isocyanate group (toluene 2,4-diisocyanate (TDI), isophorone diisocyanate (IPDI), etc.) and a hydroxyl group (2-hydroxyethyl methacrylate (HEMA), 2-hydroxyethyl acrylate (HEA), etc.). The isocyanate groups are responsible for the stiffness and hardness properties whereas hydroxyl groups give flexibility to the oligomer. PUA oligomers are favored due to the excellent chemical resistance, good adherence and durability, superior thermo-mechanical properties. The aim of the present thesis work is to develope new types of formaldehyde-free adhesive formulations that will show a good bonding in textile cord fabric/rubber composites. In the first stage, bisphenol-A type epoxy was reacted with acrylic acid (AA) at various molar concentrations. The effects of carboxyl/epoxide ratio and vinylphosphonic acid (VPA) content on the thermal characteristics and adhesion properties of coatings were investigated. The obtained EA oligomers were characterized by Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) and proton nuclear magnetic resonance (1H NMR) spectroscopies. The completion of photopolymerization was proven by FTIR analysis by observing the disappearance of acrylate absorption peak after UV curing. Adhesive formulations were prepared by using the synthesized EA oligomers and then coated on cord fabrics via dip-coating process. The unsaturated groups of the oligomer were crosslinked onto the cord fabric by using UV light. The thermal properties of EA coated UV-cured cord fabric samples were searched by thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC). After coating and UV-curing stage, thermal stability increased because of the increment in carbon amount. The EA layer provided more amorphous structure thus lower melting temperature values were observed compared to the cord fabric. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images showed that EA coated fiber surface gained a smoother structure without any agglomeration. Contact angle measurement of the UV-cured cord surface proved that AA increment in oligomer caused a more hydrophobic behavior because hydroxyl groups of the acid form hydrogen bonding with the oxygen atom of the polyester cord fabric. After UV-curing stage, cord fabrics were put between two styrene-butadiene-rubber (SBR) layers and thermally cured by using heat and pressure in order to adhere the treated cord surface to the rubber layer. After dual-curing process, peel test was applied to evaluate the adhesion property of the oligomer. Peel testing results showed that the best peel strength with 18.0 N/cm has been obtained when the carboxyl/epoxide ratio was set as 1. The highest acrylate functionality in the oligomer structure allows more connection point between the double bonds of SBR during the thermal curing process. When VPA was included to the adhesion formulation as adhesion promoter higher adhesion strength values were obtained with flame resistant property. This result can be explained by the flame retardant property of the phosphorous in VPA inherently. Furthermore, when VPA amount in the formulation increases, thermal stability and char formation also increases. ECE washing process and NaOH treatment were applied on cord fabrics before coating process, in order to increase wettability character of the surface with a more functionalized property. The highest adhesion strength value (50.8 N/cm) was recorded in the sample having 10 % VPA in the formulation. In the second stage of the thesis, bio-based adhesive formulations were designed to adhere textile cords and rubber. Tung oil (TO) was chosen as a bio-source due to the high degree of unsaturation compared to other vegetable oils, providing opportunity to design new oligomeric structures. For the oligomer synthesis, TO was firstly epoxidized and then reacted with AA. The obtained epoxidized tung oil (ETO) and acrylated epoxidized tung oil (AETO) oligomers were characterized by FTIR, 1H-NMR spectroscopies, thermal analysis and then applied between the textile cord and rubber surfaces as adhesive. Contact angle measurement was performed from the coated UV-cured cord fabric surfaces. Peel test was used to evaluate the adhesion strength between coated UV-cured cord and rubber surfaces. Results showed that thermo-oxidative stability of TO increased after the inclusion of epoxide groups to the structure. Contact angle values decreased with increasing AETO amount in the adhesive formulation due to the hydrophilic character of epoxidized free fatty acids. The highest peel strength values of 26.0 N/cm and 20.5 N/cm were obtained with the inclusion of 50 % AETO and 75 % VPAMETO to the formulation. In the last stage of the thesis, dual-curable formaldehyde-free adhesive formulations were prepared with the reaction of TDI and HEMA and then the obtained PUA oligomers were included into the formulations by using different types of reactive diluents. Polyvinyl butyral (PVB) was also included to the formulation as an adhesion promoter. All oligomers were characterized by FTIR and 1H NMR spectroscopies. The adhesion formulations were applied on cord fabrics upon adhere onto the rubber surfaces. The effects of PVB ratio, NCO:OH molar ratio, and reactive diluent types on adhesion strength in cord/rubber composites were all investigated. Results showed that after coating and UV curing stages, both thermal stability and melting temperature of the cord fabric decreased due to the inclusion of amorphous regions into the fabric structure. PVB gives strong binding ability and acts as adhesion promoter in cord fabric/rubber composites so the peel strength value increases with increasing PVB amount in the formulation. The best adhesion strength value of 94.7 N/cm was observed when 5 % PVB was included in the formulation. Trimethylolpropane trimethacrylate (TMPTMA) and tricyclodecane dimethanol diacrylate (TCDDA) were used as reactive diluents in the adhesive formulations. The bulky and cyclic nature of tricyclodecane unit in TCDDA gives to the coating formulation a higher thermal stability, higher rigidity, with a better peel strength compared to the TMPTMA included samples. The highest adhesion strength value of 100.4 N/cm was recorded when TCDDA was used as reactive diluent in the formulation. Considering the NCO:OH molar ratio in the oligomer, thermal stability, gel fraction, glass transition and melting temperatures, adhesion strength were all increased whilst swelling degree and weight loss with chemical exposure decreased with increasing NCO:OH ratio. This result can be explained by the trimerization reactions and formation of intermolecular hydrogen bonding resulting a highly crosslinked, three dimensional structure with less molecular mobility and higher adhesive strength. The highest adhesion strength of 103 N/cm was obtained when the NCO:OH ratio was set as 4. Furthermore, TCDDA and TMPTMA were used together as reactive diluent in various ratios. The adhesion strength was investigated in terms of reactive diluent composition. Accordingly, the highest adhesion strength value of 111.6 N/cm was recorded in the sample having only TCDDA as reactive diluent. As mentioned before, this result can be explained by the increase in surface functionality due to the cyclic, bulky nature of tricyclodecane units in TCDDA.DoktoraPh.D The EVA Contactor four door sedan, an electric passenger vehicle, was tested to characterize the state-of-the-art of electric vehicles. It is a four passenger sedan that was converted to an electric vehicle. It is powered by 16 series connected 6 volt electric vehicle batteries through a four step contactor controller actuated by a foot accelerator pedal. The controller changes the voltage applied to the separately excited DC motor. The braking system is a vacuum assisted hydraulic braking system. Regenerative braking was also provided The EVA Change-of-Pace Coupe, is an electric passenger vehicle, to characterize the state-of-the-art of electric vehicles. The EVA Change-of-Pace Coupe is a four passenger sedan that has been coverted to an electric vehicle. It is powered by twenty 6 volt traction batteries through a silicon controlled rectifier chopper controller actuated by a foot throttle to change the voltage applied to the series wound, direct current motor. Braking is accomplished with a vacuum assist hydraulic braking system. Regenerative braking is also provided The influence of new modifiers of adhesion on the technologi cal properties of the unfilled elastomer compositions based on synthetic isoprene rubber SKI-3 is investigated. Synthesized adhesion promoters constitute silica acid fillers modified with cobalt, nickel, and a combination  of cobalt and nickel. This fillers contain are duced number (compared with industrial cobalt stearate) of ions of metals of variable valence on the surface. The samples were investigated by roentgenofluorescsence analysis on wave x-ray fluorescence spectrometer Axios (PANalytical, Netherlands) to establish the quantitative composition of the adhesion modifiers. Tests are carried out to determine the dependency of the change of Mooney viscosity of rubber mixtures, relaxation 
processes, occurring in volume of an elastomer matrix, and the time to reach the optimal degree of vulcanization of the investigated dosages of the adhesion promoters and amounts of metal ions on their surface.  The type and dosage of the synthesized promoters of adhesion of rubber to the brass plated steel cord are established that improve the technological  properties of the unfilled  elastomer compositions.  
It is revealed that the introduction of rubber mixt ures based on SKI-3 cobalt-containing modified silica acid fillers with 7.3 and 9.3 wt % allows obtaining elastomeric compositions with similar properties to the compositions containing industrial cobalt stearate This document contains presentations and discussions from the joint UVA/NASA Workshop on Computational Modeling of Tires. The workshop attendees represented NASA, the Army and Air force, tire companies, commercial software developers, and academia. The workshop objectives were to assess the state of technology in the computational modeling of tires and to provide guidelines for future research This paper deals with to describe the material properties of rubber-cord elastic element necessary for assessment of pneumatic-flexible element by means of Finite Element Method (FEM). A viscoelastic constitutive model of rubbercord composite is established by introduction of strain energy density function. For description of material properties of rubber-cord element is used a curve, i.e. the experimentally determined curve of Mooney-Rivlin material. The relevant constants were determined on the basis of tensile test of rubber-cord element. Results are presented for a material of pneumatic-flexible element of differential pneumatic flexible coupling with autoregulation This paper presents the results of studies to achieve adequate steel cord adhesion whilst seeking to improve hysteresis characteristics and to reduce compound heat generation through the use of chemically activated aramid fibers called Sulfron 3001. This unique ingredient is capable of reducing the compound hysteresis significantly. This reduction of hysteresis translates into lower heat generation and consequently better adhesion to steel cord, especially under dynamic environments Laboratory studies were carried out to investigate the effect of single overloads on subsequent fatigue life of typical nylon tire cord. A simplified method was developed for fabricating end grips for tensile load ing of tire cords. Test results showed little influence of significantly large overloads on the subsequent fatigue life of nylon tire cord.Peer Reviewedhttp://deepblue.lib.umich.edu/bitstream/2027.42/68873/2/10.1177_152808377500400303.pd Adhesion between reinforcing fibers and the matrix is crucial for a good performance of a wide variety of elastomeric products. RFL treatment is most commonly used to achieve rubber-fiber adhesion for decades; however, there are health concerns related to this method. Therefore, alternative methods to partly or completely replace the RFL treatment are currently developed. A new approach for adhesion enhancement is plasma treatment of the fiber/cord. This process allows to physically and chemically modify the cord surface and thus to increase compatibility with and reactivity towards the elastomeric matrix. In this study, an atmospheric plasma jet was used to coat polymeric cord surfaces with an adhesive layer in a pilot-scale continuously operating line. The precursors used for the chemical surface modification of the cords carried sulfuric moieties and/or unsaturated carbon-carbon bonds, to result in functional groups reactive towards the polymer after the plasma polymerization and deposition on the cord surface. The crucial components of the equipment, process parameters, and pre- as well as post-treatments were elaborated. The results in terms of cord properties as well as adhesion strength of different types of cords to an elastomeric compound will be discussed. Furthermore, an overview of the advantages and disadvantages of the resulting cord/rubber interface in comparison to the industrial standard will be given The design and fabrication of a molded, coated fabric elbow joint capable of operating reliably at 8 psi internal pressure for extended periods of flexure is considered. The overall design of the joint includes: (1) selection of heatsettable fiber of sufficient strengths; (2) choosing an optimum fabric construction; (3) a fatigue resistant; flexible coating; and (4) a molding technique. A polyester yarn of type 56 Dacron and a urethane coating system were selected. The relationships between yarn and weave parameters which lead to an optimum fabric construction for the 8 psi elbow joint are defined The basic formulation of plane stress-analysis techniques for textiles imbedded in rubber is given both from the viewpoint of a load-carrying net and of a continuous elastic material with orthotropic properties. The developments are basically dissimilar, and yet it is shown that, for material properties commonly encountered in rubber-coated textiles, both theories predict essentially the same textile loads, although the stresses carried by the rubber matrix differ in the two theories. This shows that the network approach, which is by far the simpler of the two, is perfectly valid for purposes of estimat ing cord load in cord-rubber structural members. A method is presented through the use of either theory to compute the fraction of load carried by the cord network and the fraction carried by the rubber matrix.Peer Reviewedhttp://deepblue.lib.umich.edu/bitstream/2027.42/68771/2/10.1177_004051756803800908.pd"	['151181780', '142211856', '39551034', '150259334', '157035616', '10963428', '26240541', '51712776', '24910979', '45432554', '24909599', '158879450', '45454590', '148921949', '24835388', '128132175', '19799817', '155115854', '1248440', '45464698', '146381304', '24904476', '45431946', '1248047']	[[{'name': 'Blume, Anke'}, {'name': 'Dierkes, Wilma K.'}, {'name': 'Louis, A.'}, {'name': 'Noordermeer, Jacobus W.M.'}], [{'name': 'Inês Peixoto da Silva'}], [{'name': 'Larin, Oleksiy'}, {'name': 'Petrova, Iuliia'}], [{'name': 'Jakovljević, Živana'}, {'name': 'Petrović, Petar'}], [{'name': 'C.

This study provides the first laboratory test of this hypothesis in naturally occurring, rather than artificially induced, cravings. Participants reported if they were experiencing a craving and rated the strength, vividness and intrusiveness of their craving. They then either played 'Tetris' or they waited for a computer program to load (they were told it would load, but it was designed not to). Before task completion, craving scores between conditions did not differ; after, however, participants who had played 'Tetris' had significantly lower craving and less vivid craving imagery. The findings support EI theory, showing that a visuospatial working memory load reduces naturally occurring cravings, and that Tetris might be a useful task for tackling cravings outside the laboratory. Methodologically, the findings show that craving can be studied in the laboratory without using craving induction procedures The Elaborated Intrusion (EI) theory of desire posits that visual imagery plays a key role in craving. We report a series of experiments testing this hypothesis in a drug addiction context. Experiment 1 showed that a mental visual imagery task with neutral content reduced cigarette craving in abstaining smokers, but that an equivalent auditory task did not. The effect of visual imagery was replicated in Experiment 2, which also showed comparable effects of non-imagery visual working memory interference. Experiment 3 showed that the benefit of visual over auditory interference was not dependent upon imagery being used to induce craving. Experiment 4 compared a visuomotor task, making shapes from modeling clay, with a verbal task (counting back from 100), and again showed a benefit of the visual over the non-visual task. We conclude that visual imagery supports craving for cigarettes. Competing imagery or visual working memory tasks may help tackle craving in smokers trying to quit Elaborated Intrusion Theory (EI) postulates that imagery is central to craving, therefore a visually based task should decrease craving and craving imagery.

Methodologically, the findings show that craving can be studied in the laboratory without using craving induction procedures BackgroundMultiple measures are utilized to assess alcohol craving, often interchangeably. Little is known about the relationship between tonic and phasic craving. This study fills this gap in the literature by examining the association between tonic levels of alcohol craving and phasic craving for alcohol that is provoked by alcohol administration.MethodsForty-three non-treatment seeking problem drinkers underwent an initial interview and two laboratory testing sessions, where either alcohol or a saline placebo was administered intravenously. Tonic craving was assessed via the Penn Alcohol Craving Scale (PACS) and Obsessive Compulsive Drinking Scale (OCDS) at the initial interview. Phasic craving was assessed during the laboratory sessions (i.e., alcohol and saline administrations, single blinded) at baseline and at 3 subsequent breath alcohol concentrations (0.02, 0.04, and 0.06 g/dl).ResultsThere was a main effect of PACS in predicting phasic craving across both saline and alcohol administration conditions (p &lt; 0.05). The OCDS was predictive of phasic craving when alcohol, but not saline, was administered (p = 0.058); the obsessive subscale (p = 0.01), but not the compulsive subscale (p &gt; 0.10), predicted phasic craving during alcohol, as compared to saline administration.ConclusionIn sum, tonic craving captured by the OCDS was predictive of phasic craving during alcohol administration whereas the PACS more generally captured the increase in phasic craving. Therefore, these measures of tonic craving may function differently in capturing the experience of phasic craving. Implications for the utilization of the PACS and OCDS as well as assessments of craving in alcoholism research are discussed Thesis (M.A.)--Boston UniversityBackground: The recognized spectrum of impulse control disorders in Parkinson’s disease (PD) includes pathologic gambling, hypersexuality, compulsive buying, and binge eating, and is commonly related to exposure to dopamine agonist medications. Sweet craving in the general population is a phenomenon that is closely linked to several factors, including poor impulse control. Craving for sweets, though recognized to occur in PD, has not previously been studied.
Methods: First, patients with idiopathic PD and normal controls who reported craving sweets completed craving questionnaires (CQ), taste threshold testing, assessment of mood symptoms and olfactory testing. CQ scores were correlated with these results and other demographic information. A pathologic craving score was identified as the 75th percentile of the mean CQ score for all PD patients. Second, patients with PD and controls completed a series of questionnaires addressing the presence of a variety of 
impulse control disorders and sweet craving to determine the prevalence of sweet craving in PD and disease and medication-related factors that are associated with each.
Results: Craving for sweets is present in about 5.5% of patients with idiopathic PD. Similar to the determinants of other ICDs, determinants of sweet craving include female gender (p=0.0001), decreased olfactory function (t-test: p=0.0001; fisher’s exact method: comparing QSIT scores of 0 and 2 (p=0.0179), 0 and 3 (p=0.0182)), self-reported current or past history of depression (p=0.048) and obsessive-compulsive traits (p=0.044), higher Hoehn & Yahr staging (p=0.0001; fisher’s exact method: no significance), younger onset of disease (p=0.015), and longer duration of disease (p=0.003).
Conclusions: Craving for sweets in PD is similar in its phenomenology to other recognized ICDs in this population of patients. Though the potential implications of this behavior may be less hazardous than those of other pathologic behaviors, it broadens the spectrum of ICDs that should be recognized in PD and discussed with patients The role of aggressivity and cue exposure in induction of craving were investigated in a clinical setting. Thirty abstinent alcoholic patients were divided into a low and a high aggressive group based on scores on the physical aggression subscale of the Buss-Durkee Hostility Inventory and exposed to alcohol cues. Craving was measured by means of the Alcohol Craving Questionnaire (ACQ) and Visual Analogue Scales (VAS). Important findings are: (1) main effects of aggressivity on `emotionality', `purposefulness' and `expectancy' of ACQ were very significant; (2) on `drinking intention' and `craving for alcohol' of VAS, aggressivity and cue exposure showed a significant interaction; (3) the main effect of cue exposure on heart rate also reached a significance level of 0.007. The results were discussed in the context of the Classical, Operant Conditioning Theory, the Cognitive Craving Theory of Tiffany, Gilbert's STAR Model, and the Self-Medication Hypothesis Copyright (C) 2001 S. Karger AG, Basel IntroductionThe Penn Alcohol Craving Scale (PACS) is one of the most widely used instruments to measure craving for alcohol. Recent research has suggested that scores on the PACS can be used as a ""stand in"" for the diagnostic criterion of alcohol craving with a proposed cutoff of &gt;20 on the PACS indicating a ""positive"" alcohol craving symptom. The present study examined the convergence between the PACS and face-to-face diagnostic interview for the assessment of alcohol craving.MethodA sample of non-treatment seeking heavy drinkers (N = 338) enrolled in experimental studies of AUD completed the PACS as well as a face-to-face diagnostic interview for AUD, which included the craving item from the Semi-Structured Assessment for the Genetics of Alcoholism (SSAGA).ResultsUsing the PACS cut-off score of &gt;20, 12.9% (N = 43) of the sample met criteria for alcohol craving compared to 21% (N = 74) of the sample meeting criteria based on the diagnostic interview. Using the PACS cutoff of &gt;20, sensitivity (i.e., true positive rate) was 41% and specificity (i.e., true negative rate) was 95%. Exploratory analyses suggested that a cut-off score of ≥15 achieved the optimal balance of sensitivity (67%) and specificity (81%) in our sample.ConclusionsAdvancing the assessment of alcohol craving and the conversion from DSM-IV to DSM-5 diagnostic criteria represents an important research direction. The present study recommends that a PACS score cut off of ≥15 should be used as an indicator of clinically significant alcohol craving in community samples of non-treatment seekers Cue-induced drug craving progressively increases after prolonged withdrawal from drug self-administration in laboratory animals, a behavioral phenomenon termed 'incubation of drug craving.' Studies over the years have revealed several important neural mechanisms contributing to incubation of drug craving. In this mini-review, we first discuss three excellent Addiction Biology publications on incubation of drug craving in both human and laboratory animals.

cfbbd91b-cad8-4afb-9739-70a308d5d200	cassava peeling machine	"The study was the design and development of a cassava peeling machine to reduce drudgery and improve the productivity of cassava processing into various foods. The cassava peeling machine consists of the peeling drum (with both knife and abrasive embedded), conveyor, electric motor, and speed reducer. The machine was designed using solid work software. The peeler was evaluated with cassava root length of about 300mm. The speed range of 90-120rpm was used to test the performance of the peeler. The average capacity of the developed machine was 450kg/h, with a peeling efficiency of 90%. The root loss of 5% and peel retention of 5% were obtained during machine test. The various shapes of cassava roots do not affect the machine's functionality as it functions well on the different shapes and sizes of cassava roots. Results also show that the machine is affordable and efficient and is recommended to improve the processing productivity of cassava food products. It is therefore, recommended that further research be carried out on cassava roots geometry and thickness to further improve the peeling efficiency of the machine. Modelling of the cassava peeling process should be studied, taking into consideration the physical parameters; towards identifying any flaw that needs improvement in the present design. More research should be carried on the utilization of alternative sources of energy like solar to power the machine at a minimal energy cost Cassava peeling has become the major problem of cassava processing worldwide. This is attributed to the irregularity in shape, size and thickness across different varieties of cassava tubers. The aim of this research work is to compare the peeling performance of type 3 cassava peeling machine with two (2) abrasive peeling tools and type 4 cassava peeling machine with four (4) abrasive peeling tools. The machines were evaluated at four (4) different speeds; (80rev/min, 90rev/min, 100rev/min, and 110rev/min) with 5HP electric motor. Cassava tubers of average mass of 0.72kg, 0.74kg, 0.76kg, 0.78kg and 0.80kg were used for the experiment. The results of the properties evaluated for type 3 and type 4 peelers at 80 rev/min are; mass of peeled cassava (80% and 86%), mass of cassava peels (16% and 18%), mass of cassava flesh loss (2.06% and 2.16%), mass of unpeeled cassava (0.85% and 0.75%), peeling efficiency (85% and 90%), mechanical damage (0.046kg/kg and 0.065kg/kg), throughput capacity (1141kg/h and 1262kg/h) respectively. The performance of type 4 peeler was generally better than type 3 peeler with regards to properties evaluated, except for the percentage flesh loss and mechanical damage which were better with type 3 peeler.Keywords: Abrasive, Varieties, Throughput, Processing, Peele Cassava peeling constitutes global challenge despite increasing consumption of its end products.  To provide scientific approach for mechanical peeling, the movement of tuber in the peeling chamber was analyzed and validated.  Dimensional analysis was used to establish model equations for predicting the relationship between dimensionless functional properties, and crop and machine parameters.   An improved cassava variety and 2014 model cassava peeler was used for the experiment. The effective machine speed varied from 100-140 r/min for smooth-edge and 140-160 r/min for serrated-edge cutting tool.  The results showed that when using smooth-edge; peeling efficiency (μ) was ranged from 84.97%-94.60%, mechanical damage (λ) was ranged from 1.57%-11.19%, peel retention (P) was ranged from 5.41%-15.03% and throughput (η) was ranged from 387.10-1046.50 kg/h.  When using serrated-edge, μ was ranged from 81.24%-91.36%, λ was ranged from 6.36%-8.41%, P was ranged from 8.64%-19.34% and η was ranged from 248.28-625.00 kg/h.  A linear relationship was established between the machine speed versus ratio of velocity of conveyance and peeling time Abstract This work focused on the design and construction of a batch cassava peeling machine able to handle one diametric size of cassava tubers. The principle of abrasive peeling using a stationary outer abrasive drum and a rotating inner abrasive drum was used based on a batch capacity of 8.5 kg and cut tuber lengths of 200mm and diameters of 90mm. An average peeling efficiency recorded was 70.45 percent while the average flesh loss was 5.09 percent. Percentage of broken cassava was estimated as 2% A comparative analysis of type 1 and type 2 cassava peeling machines with nail lengths of 26mm and 20mm were investigated in order to improve peeling techniques of cassava tubers. The machines were evaluated at four (4) different speeds; (80rev/min, 90rev/min, 100rev/min, and 110rev/min), with 750HP petrol engine. Cassava tubers were graded into average weights of 0.81kg, 0.72kg, 0.64kg, 0.55kg, 0.50kg. The results of the properties evaluated for type1 and type 2 peelers are: Weight of peeled cassava (85% and 78%) at 80rev/min respectively, Weight of cassava peels (16% and 15.66%) at 80rev/min respectively, Weight of cassava flesh loss (0.7% and 3.26%) at 80rev/min respectively, weight of unpeeled cassava (0.7% and 3.26%) at 80rev/min respectively, Peeling efficiency (88% and 82%) at 80rev/min respectively, Mechanical damage (0.0084kg and 0.040kg) at 80rev/min respectively, Throughput capacity (1041kg/h and 1149kg/h) at 110rev/min respectively, The results of the properties evaluated for type 1 peeler were better than type 2 peeler.Key words: Nails, Weight, Cassava, Peelers, Flesh loss Banyuwangi produces potential cassava chips. However, due to slow manual stripping, production capacity is low, market demand is high, and product quality decreases. This study develops an optimized peeling machine using NIDA-QFD to meet user needs and increase innovation. Experimental design model and 5 alternative actions of cassava peeling machine. ABC Banyuwangi Industry with 10 respondents, including owners and employees, was given intervention in the action decision. NIDA-QFD developed a cassava peeling machine design that is efficient and minimizes risk. Alternative 3 was chosen, with user body dimensions (height 110-180 cm), using sturdy materials (steel angle profile, stainless steel plate), and having 5 peeling rolls (diameter 80 mm, length 910 mm) for an effective and efficient stripping process. The 220 volt 1/2 PK AC drive system ensures the roll rotates with optimal speed and torque. The cassava skin remover is made of stainless steel which is rust-resistant and easy to clean, so it is feasible to overcome the problem of manual peeling of cassava and opportunities for progress in the cassava chips industry Singkong dapat diolah menjadi tepung singkong termodifikasi (modified cassava flour/mocaf) yang memiliki karakterisasi mirip dengan tepung terigu.

Developing of cassava flour is has great opportunity and has not been socialized properly. Cassava can be processed into modified cassava flour (mocaf) which has a good characterization similar to wheat flour. Besides, with the development of this nem modified cassava flour was found to reduce Indonesia’s dependence on imported wheat flour. Production process of modified cassava flour is preceded by peeling process. All this time, the process of peeling was done manually. Manual peeling process takes a long time to support the production process of modified cassava flour, it takes a lot of labor in the peeling process. Developing an equipment to help peeling process is needed for production process of modified cassava flour. This final project clims to develop a cassava peeling machine mechanically, then the machine was fabricated and tested. This prototype under rotation peeling principle which driven by an electric motor. Peeling process is do in a vertical position and material which used as a tool for peeling proses is an iron wire which serves as an cassava peel. The prototype was made from a frame which have dimensions 50 cm x 39 cm x 55 cm with a L-profile mild steel material. The casing was made from mild steel with fit size with frame. Peeler components were made from stainless steel has a length 18 cm and diameter 10 cm. The machine was tested by feeding of cassava vertically. The test results shown that its peeling mechanism is promise to be alicable commercially"	['138484495', '122602931', '112520714', '100998668', '138556375', '160795139', '38495769']	[[{'name': 'Aririguzo, J.

Clearly, there is a good deal of subjectivity in distinguishing good from bad, but there may be some basic characteristics that mark out a research paper from any other kind of paper, and it is good research papers that we would like to encourage at the annual conference While collaborative filtering and citation analysis have been well studied for research paper recommender systems, content-based approaches typically restrict themselves to straightforward application of the vector space model. However, various types of metadata containing potentially useful information are usually available as well. Our work explores several methods to exploit this information in combination with different similarity measures Latest issue of the Toilet paper research newsletter detailing progress on the TACT3 and RATs research project iven its briefness, inherent complexity and massive and critical use in scientific discourse, the research paper abstract (RP A) is a text type particularly interesting for both linguistic modelling (writing and reading) and automatic processing (generation and parsing). Even though the current literature on these fields is large and promising, there are still various gaps to fill, especially in the domain of the interplay between linguistic modelling and the development of applications for the solution of communication problems. Our purpose here is to present the RedACTe Project's approach to the design of software oriented to rhetorical and linguistic assistance in RP A writingFil: Castel, Víctor M. The world's two population giants have undergone significant, and significantly different, demographic transitions since the 1950s. The demographic dividends associated with these transitions during the first three decades of this century are examined using a global economic model that incorporates full demographic behavior and measures of dependency that reflect the actual number of workers to non-workers, rather than the number of working aged to non-working aged. While much of China's demographic dividend now lies in the past, alternative assumptions about future trends in fertility and labor force participation rates are used to demonstrate that China will not necessarily enter a period of “demographic taxation” for at least another decade, if not longer. In contrast with China, much of India's potential demographic dividend lies in waiting for the decades ahead, with the extent and duration depending critically on a range of policy choices. This paper gives an overview of DORAS – an online open access repository of research papers from Dublin City University – and explores how repositories like DORAS are increasing the visibility, and potentially the impact, of research output from educational institutions. In this

paper the main motivations for authors to deposit papers in DORAS are identified: increasing the accessibility of papers, increasing the visibility of papers on search engines and web portals, promotion of cutting-edge research, and the need to comply with research councils' policies on open access Web service behaviour is currently specified in a mixture of ways, often using methods that are only partially complete. These range from static functional specifications, based on interfaces in WSDL and preconditions in RIF, to business process simulations using executable process-based models such as BPEL, to detailed quality of service (QoS) agreements laid down in a service level agreement (SLA). This paper recognises that something similar to a SLA is required at the higher business level to govern the contract between service producers, brokers and consumers. We call this a business level agreement (BLA) and within this framework, seek to unify disparate aspects of functional specification, QoS and run-time verification. We propose that the method for validating a web service with respect to its advertised BLA should be based on run-time service monitoring. This is a position paper towards defining these goals When we think about what we are doing as researchers, one of our main tasks is to acquire knowledge. For some researchers their task begins and ends there. Knowledge is viewed as cumulative, that by adding to some knowledge pool we will one day be able to put the component parts together and discover universal laws. Many researchers also assume that the knowledge they have collected is objective, value-free and apolitical. This is part of psychologists’ ‘physics envy’. A Maori view of knowledge is very different from this. For Maori the purpose of knowledge is to uphold the interests and the mana of the group; it serves the community. Researchers are not building up their own status; they are fighting for the betterment of their iwi and for Maori people in general The effects of exchange rate policies are examined for a small open economy in an infinite horizon model with investment, labor/leisure choice, and cash-in-advance for consumption. An increase in the rate of depreciation of the domestic currency reduces consumption and labor supply, as the higher inflation increases the price of consumption relative to leisure. The fall in labor reduces the marginal productivity of capital, and a fall in investment. The country runs a current account surplus, despite the fall in output. The dynamics of the model for permanent, temporary and anticipated policy changes are fully worked out.Employment, Investment, Current Account, Cash-in-Advance Ontologies of research areas are important tools for characterising, exploring and analysing the research landscape. We recently released the Computer Science Ontology (CSO), a large-scale, automatically generated ontology of research areas, which includes about 26K topics and 226K semantic relationships. CSO currently powers several tools adopted by the Springer Nature editorial team and has been used to enable a variety of solutions, such as classifying research publications, detecting research communities, and predicting research trends. As an effort to encourage the usage of CSO, we have developed the CSO Portal, a web application that enables users to download, explore, and provide granular feedbacks at different levels of the ontology. In this paper, we present the CSO Classifier, an application for automatically classifying academic papers according to the rich taxonomy of topics from CSO. The aim is to facilitate the adoption of CSO across the various communities engaged with scholarly data and to foster the development of new applications based on this knowledge base As a profession when we look to expand our skills, learn new techniques and expand visual communication in healthcare as an area of knowledge research papers become a valuable resource as references, to support this work.

87ff8601-2096-4293-9171-4230ed5ea6f7	amyloidosis	"We demonstrated that an antibiotic cocktail (ABX)-perturbed gut microbiome is associated with reduced amyloid-β (Aβ) plaque pathology and astrogliosis in the male amyloid precursor protein (APP)SWE /presenilin 1 (PS1)ΔE9 transgenic model of Aβ amyloidosis. We now show that in an independent, aggressive APPSWE/PS1L166P (APPPS1-21) mouse model of Aβ amyloidosis, an ABX-perturbed gut microbiome is associated with a reduction in Aβ pathology and alterations in microglial morphology, thus establishing the generality of the phenomenon. Most importantly, these latter alterations occur only in brains of male mice, not in the brains of female mice. Furthermore, ABX treatment lead to alterations in levels of selected microglial expressed transcripts indicative of the ""M0"" homeostatic state in male but not in female mice. Finally, we found that transplants of fecal microbiota from age-matched APPPS1-21 male mice into ABX-treated APPPS1-21 male restores the gut microbiome and partially restores Aβ pathology and microglial morphology, thus demonstrating a causal role of the microbiome in the modulation of Aβ amyloidosis and microglial physiology in mouse models of Aβ amyloidosis Background Cardiac amyloidosis is a fatal disease whose prognosis and treatment rely on identification of the amyloid type. In our aging population transthyretin amyloidosis (ATTRwt) is common and must be differentiated from other amyloid types. We report the clinical presentation, natural history, and prognostic features of ATTRwt compared with cardiac‐isolated AL amyloidosis and calculate the probability of disease diagnosis of ATTRwt from baseline factors.



Methods and Results All patients with biopsy‐proven ATTRwt (102 cases) and isolated cardiac AL (36 cases) seen from 2002 to 2011 at the UK National Amyloidosis Center were included. Median survival from the onset of symptoms was 6.07 years in the ATTRwt group and 1.7 years in the AL group. Positive troponin, a pacemaker, and increasing New York Heart Association (NYHA) class were associated with worse survival in ATTRwt patients on univariate analysis. All patients with isolated cardiac AL and 24.1% of patients with ATTRwt had evidence of a plasma cell dyscrasia. Older age and lower N‐terminal pro‐B‐type natriuretic peptide (NT pro‐BNP) were factors significantly associated with ATTRwt. Patients aged 70 years and younger with an NT pro‐BNP <183 pmol/L were more likely to have ATTRwt, as were patients older than 70 years with an NT pro‐BNP <1420 pmol/L.



Conclusions Factors at baseline associated with a worse outcome in ATTRwt are positive troponin T, a pacemaker, and NYHA class IV symptoms. The age of the patient at diagnosis and NT pro‐BNP level can aid in distinguishing ATTRwt from AL amyloidosis Background: Chronic renal disease is a serious complication of long-term intravenous drug use (IVDU). Recent reports have postulated a changing pattern of underlying nephropathy over the last decades.

Methods: Retrospective investigation including all patients with prior or present IVDU that underwent renal biopsy because of chronic kidney disease between 01.04.2002 and 31.03.2012 in the city of Frankfurt/Main, Germany.

Results: Twenty four patients with IVDU underwent renal biopsy because of progressive chronic kidney disease or proteinuria. Renal AA-amyloidosis was the predominant cause of renal failure in 50% of patients. Membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis (GN) was the second most common cause found in 21%. Patients with AA-amyloidosis were more likely to be HIV infected (67 vs.17%; p=0.036) and tended to have a higher rate of repeated systemic infections (92 vs. 50%; p=0.069). Patients with AA-amyloidosis presented with progressive renal disease and nephrotic-range proteinuria but most patients had no peripheral edema or systemic hypertension. Development of proteinuria preceded the decline of GFR for approximately 1--2 years.

Conclusions: AA-amyloidosis was the predominant cause of progressive renal disease in the last 10 years in patients with IVDU. The highest rate of AA-amyloidosis observed was seen in HIV infected patients with IVDU. We speculate that chronic HIV-infection as well as the associated immunosuppression might promote development of AA-amyloidosis by increasing frequency and duration of infections acquired by IVDU BACKGROUND:Deposition of amyloid fibrils derived from circulating acute-phase reactant serum amyloid A protein (SAA) causes systemic AA amyloidosis, a serious complication of many chronic inflammatory disorders. Little is known about the natural history of AA amyloidosis or its response to treatment.METHODS:We evaluated clinical features, organ function, and survival among 374 patients with AA amyloidosis who were followed for a median of 86 months. The SAA concentration was measured serially, and the amyloid burden was estimated with the use of whole-body serum amyloid P component scintigraphy. Therapy for inflammatory diseases was administered to suppress the production of SAA.RESULTS:Median survival after diagnosis was 133 months; renal dysfunction was the predominant disease manifestation. Mortality, amyloid burden, and renal prognosis all significantly correlated with the SAA concentration during follow-up. The risk of death was 17.7 times as high among patients with SAA concentrations in the highest eighth, or octile, (greater/equal 155 mg per liter) as among those with concentrations in the lowest octile (< 4 mg per liter); and the risk of death was four times as high in the next-to-lowest octile (4 to 9 mg per liter). The median SAA concentration during follow-up was 6 mg per liter in patients in whom renal function improved and 28 mg per liter in those in whom it deteriorated (P < 0.001). Amyloid deposits regressed in 60% of patients who had a median SAA concentration of less than 10 mg per liter, and survival among these patients was superior to survival among those in whom amyloid deposits did not regress (P=0.04).CONCLUSIONS:The effects of renal dysfunction dominate the course of AA amyloidosis, which is associated with a relatively favorable outcome in patients with SAA concentrations that remain in the low-normal range (< 4 mg per liter) Epidemiological studies of systemic amyloidosis are scarce and the burden of disease in England has not previously been estimated. In 1999, the National Health Service commissioned the National Amyloidosis Centre (NAC) to provide a national clinical service for all patients with amyloidosis. Data for all individuals referred to the NAC is held on a comprehensive central database, and these were compared with English death certificate data for amyloidosis from 2000 to 2008, obtained from the Office of National Statistics. Amyloidosis was stated on death certificates of 2543 individuals, representing 0·58/1000 recorded deaths. During the same period, 1143 amyloidosis patients followed at the NAC died, 903 (79%) of whom had amyloidosis recorded on their death certificates. The estimated minimum incidence of systemic amyloidosis in the English population in 2008, based on new referrals to the NAC, was 0·4/100 000 population. The incidence peaked at age 60-79 years. Systemic AL amyloidosis was the most common type with an estimated minimum incidence of 0·3/100 000 population. Although there are various limitations to this study, the available data suggest the incidence of systemic amyloidosis in England exceeds 0·8/100 000 of the population Abstract:We report a case of primary laryngeal amyloidosis in a 35 year old adult patient who presented with hoarseness of voice for 6 months duration with no other symptoms. Patient was treated successfully with endoscopic excision using a microdebrider with a laryngeal blade and review of literature.Keywords: laryngeal amyloid .  Endoscopy .

6f81db84-fc19-4946-b851-dbd794bfe42d	taphonomy	"archaeological records. As a result of the manner in which human and animal remains are traditionally studied and

reported on, the analysis of taphonomic processes which affect the character of specimens between death and

incorporation into forming deposits is often confined to butchery, burning and fragmentation. This paper argues that

current methods of osteoarchaeological analysis fail to recognise the potential of a substantial and easily accessible

source of information in paying little attention to the processes of weathering, gnawing, trampling, abrasion and

longitudinal/spiral fracturing. More detailed taphonomic assessments have tended to focus on one specific process to

answer a particular research question rather than taking a holistic approach to pre-depositional affects (e.g. Outram

2001). Consequently biographies of skeletal material are only partially complete, as the period in the material existence

of bone prior to subterranean deposition is not fully investigated. The aforementioned taphonomic processes can

provide substantial evidence for human decision making regarding the treatment of different classes of remains.

This research explores the potential of holistic taphonomic analysis in a sample of c.9500 human and faunal specimens

from the Iron Age sites of Winnall Down and Danebury. These sites were selected as they are located in the heart of

Wessex, an area about which there has been considerable discourse and disagreement regarding the nature of human

and animal bone treatment in the Iron Age. Through comprehensive taphonomic analysis, highly regulated, socially

circumscribed behaviours surrounding bone handling were revealed. These results are suggestive of separate practices

relating to the treatment of human and faunal remains with the latter exhibiting significantly greater evidence of

exposure. The analysis of bone modification in features containing both human and faunal remains reveals a blurring

of the boundary between human and animal identities, as the treatment of the two classes of material differs to a

significantly lesser degree than when analysing the entire assemblage. Therefore each class of material is subjected to

a more closely related mode of treatment. This might be seen as indicative of a conceptual proximity of human and

faunal remains Twenty-five Neogene-Quaternary whales hosted in Italian museum collections and their associated fauna were analysed for evidence of whale-fall community development in shallow-water settings. The degree of bone articulation, completeness of the skeleton and lithology of the embedding sediments were used to gather information on relative water depth, water energy, sedimentation rate and overall environmental predictability around the bones. Shark teeth and hard-shelled invertebrates with a necrophagous diet in close association with the bones were used as evidence of scavenging. Fossil bone bioerosion, microbially mediated cementation and other mollusc shells in the proximity of the remains informed on past biological activity around the bones. The results are consistent with the hypothesis that shallow-water whale falls differ from their deep-water counterparts. Taphonomic pathways are more variable on the shelf and whale carcasses may not go through all steps of the ecological succession as recognised in the deep sea. Whilst the mobile scavenger and the enrichment opportunistic stages are well represented, chemosynthetic taxa typical of the sulphophilic stage were recovered only in one instance. The presence of a generalist fauna among the suspension feeding bivalves and carnivorous gastropods, and the extreme rarity of chemosynthetic taxa, suggest that predatory pressure rules out whale-fall specialists from shallow shelf settings as in analogous cold seep and vent shallow-water communities. © 2014 The Lethaia Foundation This thesis describes and elucidates the taphonomic pathways responsible for the exceptional preservation of some of the most common elements of the Sirius Passet Lagerstätte (early Cambrian), North Greenland. Investigative techniques including cathodoluminescence, are tested first on silicified molluscs from the Oligocene of Antigua, associated with a volcanic source; described in chapter 2. By describing the depositional environment of the Sirius Passet biota in detail and using a combination of analytical techniques such as SEM, EDAX, SEM-CL and elemental mapping two published papers address a number of the key research questions surrounding the unique taphonomic pathways in the Sirius Passet biota and their broader significance in understanding Cambrian ecosystems. The papers are included in the form of chapters 3 and 4 and the published versions included in the appendices. A unique, mat-dominated, tissue specific taphonomic pathway is proposed, more akin to the Proterozoic than the typical Burgess Shale Type (BST) preservation seen elsewhere in the Cambrian. This together with mouldic preservation indicates a range of taphonomic styles concomitant with the range of new biotas at the dawn of the Cambrian Explosion This article presents an exploratory multivariate statistical approach to gaining a more comprehensive understanding of variation in subaerial bone weathering in a British context. Weathering is among the most common

taphonomic modifications and provides a crucial line of evidence for reconstructing the taphonomic trajectories

of faunal assemblages and archaeological deposits. It provides clear evidence for prolonged subaerial exposure either before deposition in a context or because of later disturbance. In combination with other taphonomic indices such as gnawing, trampling, abrasion and fracture patterns, weathering can be used to reconstruct depositional histories and to investigate the structured treatment of different body parts or taxa in deposition. However, a broad range of factors affect the prevalence and severity of weathering, and therefore patterns can rarely be interpreted at face value. Many variables such as predepositional microenvironment cannot be traced archaeologically. Other contributory factors pertaining to the structural properties of elements and taxa can be discerned and must be taken into account in interpreting weathering signatures. However, disagreement exists regarding which variables are most important in mediating weathering. In addition for zooarchaeologists to interpret modification patterns, it is necessary for elements and taxa that are most likely to be affected by weathering to be defined. This is the case as deposits that are dominated

by those classes of remains are likely to exhibit greater modification than those that are not, even if depositional

histories were similar. Through a combination of classification tree and ordinal regression analysis, this

Sanchez (2006) reported that public schools perform favorably with private schools when students’ income and socio-economic status are taken into account The findings counter a popularly held notion, that private schools outperform public schools. Another finding by The Center on Education Policy (CEP) (2007) also indicated that private school students and public school students perform equally on achievement tests. However this study conducted on 647 second year students in two public and two private universities in Malaysia finds that students from the Public Higher Institutions perform better academically (Mean =3.25, SD =0.38) as compared to students from the Private Higher Institutions ( Mean =3.05, SD = 0.47). The students from the Public Higher Institutions seemed to do better. Hence this study also looked into some psychosocial factors (Self-efficacy , Self-esteem and Achievement Motivation ) that may lead into the explanations on the differences.. The findings are further discussed Background: Nursing students’ self-efficacy is a predictor for their educational progress. Students, who believe that they can be successful in their studies, are more confident. Therefore, many universities have focused on life skills training programs to improve the mental health of their students.



Objectives: This study was conducted to evaluate and compare self-efficacy in two groups of nursing students of Tehran University of Medical Sciences (TUMS). One group of students was trained on life skill programs, and the second group was not trained on the issue.



Materials and Methods: A case-control study was conducted on two groups of nursing students in TUMS in the late 2012. The case group (n = 112) had passed life skills training course, and the control group (n = 139) was not trained on the issue. Data was collected using a questionnaire containing 12 questions about demographic features, and the Sherer’s general self-efficacy questionnaire. Data analysis was performed using independent sample t-test, Chi-square, odds ratio, and Fisher’s exact test.



Results: In the untrained and trained groups, 23% and 8% of the students had very high self-efficacy, respectively. The overall mean scores of self-efficacy were 41.99 ± 9.31 and 38.99 ± 10.48 in the trained and untrained groups, respectively (P = 0.015), and the higher mean score indicates lower level of self-efficacy. A significant difference was also found between the self-efficacy and family income (P = 0.029).



Conclusions: The present study showed that life skills training program did not affect self-efficacy of nursing students. Perhaps, the methods used in education were influencing and then, more effective techniques such as role-play and group discussion should be substituted in life skills training This is the author's accepted manuscript.

Previous research focuses on Western stroke survivors, neglecting the stroke experience in the Middle East. This research was conducted in Kuwait and entailed both quantitative and qualitative phases to obtain a more comprehensive, clinically relevant understanding of self-efficacy and life satisfaction during stroke rehabilitation in this culture. The aims were to: 1) investigate the relationships between self-efficacy and life satisfaction in female patients affected by stroke (Phase 1); and 2) explore health professionals' views regarding the importance of self-efficacy and possible strategies for enhancing self-efficacy during rehabilitation, through semi-structured interviews (Phase 2). Significant correlations were found between patients' general self-efficacy, and psychosocial adaptation self-efficacy following stroke. Self-efficacy (both general and psychosocial adaptation) showed significant correlations with life satisfaction post-stroke. Health professionals (more than half of whom were physiotherapists) recognised the importance of self-efficacy within stroke rehabilitation and identified five main ways to increase self-efficacy during stroke rehabilitation. These were to: 1) motivate and encourage patients; 2) provide more education about stroke and rehabilitation; 3) identify change; 4) offer a high-quality environment and therapy; and 5) set goals. In conclusion, psychosocial self-efficacy was identified as having a stronger relationship to life satisfaction compared with general self-efficacy within this sample of Kuwaiti female patients. Health professionals suggested various strategies for enhancing self-efficacy and thereby life satisfaction post-stroke during the rehabilitation process in Kuwait. Despite the collectivist culture of Kuwait, the findings indicate that the patient's own confidence and sense of responsibility for progress may be relevant to rehabilitation"	['25001799', '46392278', '7984198', '46392196']	[[{'name': 'Elias, Habibah'}, {'name': 'Mahyuddin, Rahil'}, {'name': 'Noordin, Nooreen'}], [{'name': 'Dehghan Nayeri, N.'}, {'name': 'Rezayat, F.'}], [{'name': 'Omu, O'}, {'name': 'Reynolds, F'}], [{'name': 'Masoudi Alavi, N.'}]]	['Self-efficacy, self-esteem, achievement motivation and academic achievement among students in public and private higher institutions', 'Self-Efficacy After Life Skills Training: A Case-Control Study', 'Life satisfaction and self-efficacy in patients affected by a first stroke living in Kuwait: A two-phase study', 'Self-Efficacy in Nursing Students']	4.0	exploratory	0.5

carrying out a systematic and multiwavelength study of a large sample of fossil
systems. Here we focus on the relation between the optical luminosity (Lopt)
and X-ray luminosity (Lx). Out of a sample of 28 candidate fossil systems, we
consider a sample of 12 systems whose fossil classification has been confirmed
by a companion study. They are compared with the complementary sample of 16
systems whose fossil nature is not confirmed and with a subsample of 102 galaxy
systems from the RASS-SDSS galaxy cluster survey. Fossil and normal systems
span the same redshift range 0<z<0.5 and have the same Lx distribution. For
each fossil system, the Lx in the 0.1-2.4 keV band is computed using data from
the ROSAT All Sky Survey. For each fossil and normal system we homogeneously
compute Lopt in the r-band within the characteristic cluster radius, using data
from the SDSS DR7. We sample the Lx-Lopt relation over two orders of magnitude
in Lx. Our analysis shows that fossil systems are not statistically
distinguishable from the normal systems both through the 2D KS test and the fit
of the Lx-Lopt relation. The optical luminosity of the galaxy system does
strongly correlate with the X-ray luminosity of the hot gas component,
independently of whether the system is fossil or not. We conclude that our
results are consistent with the classical ""merging scenario"" of the brightest
galaxy formed via merger/cannibalism of other group galaxies, with conservation
of the optical light. We find no evidence for a peculiar state of the hot
intracluster medium.Comment: A&A, 12 pages, 4 figures, 3 tables, typos corr. and paper re-numbe We present the first pointed X-ray observations of 10 candidate fossil galaxy
groups and clusters. With these Suzaku observations, we determine global
temperatures and bolometric X-ray luminosities of the intracluster medium (ICM)
out to $r_{500}$ for six systems in our sample. The remaining four systems show
signs of significant contamination from non-ICM sources. For the six objects
with successfully determined $r_{500}$ properties, we measure global
temperatures in the range $2.8 \leq T_{\mathrm{X}} \leq 5.3 \ \mathrm{keV}$,
bolometric X-ray luminosities of $0.8 \times 10^{44} \ \leq L_{\mathrm{X,bol}}
\leq 7.7\times 10^{44} \ \mathrm{erg} \ \mathrm{s}^{-1}$, and estimate masses,
as derived from $T_{\mathrm{X}}$, of $M_{500} > 10^{14} \ \mathrm{M}_{\odot}$.
Fossil cluster scaling relations are constructed for a sample that combines our
Suzaku observed fossils with fossils in the literature. Using measurements of
global X-ray luminosity, temperature, optical luminosity, and velocity
dispersion, scaling relations for the fossil sample are then compared with a
control sample of non-fossil systems. We find the fits of our fossil cluster
scaling relations are consistent with the relations for normal groups and
clusters, indicating fossil clusters have global ICM X-ray properties similar
to those of comparable mass non-fossil systems.Comment: 17 pages, 7 figures, 8 tables. Accepted for publication in MNRA (Abridged) Fossil systems are group- or cluster-sized objects whose
luminosity is dominated by a very massive central galaxy. In the current cold
dark matter scenario, these objects formed hierarchically at an early epoch of
the Universe and then slowly evolved until present day. That is the reason why
they are called {\it fossils}. We started an extensive observational program to
characterize a sample of 34 fossil group candidates spanning a broad range of
physical properties. Deep $r-$band images were taken for each candidate and
optical spectroscopic observations were obtained for $\sim$ 1200 galaxies. This
new dataset was completed with SDSS DR7 archival data to obtain robust cluster
membership and global properties of each fossil group candidate. For each
system, we recomputed the magnitude gaps between the two brightest galaxies
($\Delta m_{12}$) and the first and fourth ranked galaxies ($\Delta m_{14}$)
within 0.5 $R_{{\rm 200}}$. We consider fossil systems those with $\Delta
m_{12} \ge 2$ mag or $\Delta m_{14} \ge 2.5$ mag within the errors. We find
that 15 candidates turned out to be fossil systems. Their observational
properties agree with those of non-fossil systems. Both follow the same
correlations, but fossils are always extreme cases. In particular, they host
the brightest central galaxies and the fraction of total galaxy light enclosed
in the central galaxy is larger in fossil than in non-fossil systems. Finally,
we confirm the existence of genuine fossil clusters. Combining our results with
others in the literature, we favor the merging scenario in which fossil systems
formed due to mergers of $L^\ast$ galaxies. The large magnitude gap is a
consequence of the extreme merger ratio within fossil systems and therefore it
is an evolutionary effect. Moreover, we suggest that at least one candidate in
our sample could represent a transitional fossil stage.Comment: 14 pages, 11 figures, accepted for publication in A& We investigate the evolution of bright and faint galaxies in fossil and
non-fossil groups. We used mock galaxies constructed based on the Millennium
run simulation II. We identified fossil groups at redshift zero according to
two different selection criteria, and then built reliable control samples of
non-fossil groups that reproduce the fossil virial mass and assembly time
distributions. The faint galaxies were defined as having r-band absolute
magnitudes in the range [-16,-11]. We analysed the properties of the bright and
faint galaxies in fossil and non-fossil groups during the past 8 Gyr. We
observed that the brightest galaxy in fossil groups is typically brighter and
more massive than their counterparts in control groups. Fossil groups developed
their large magnitude gap between the brightest galaxies around 3.5 Gyr ago.
The brightest galaxy stellar masses of all groups show a notorious increment at
that time. By analysing the behaviour of the magnitude gap between the first
and the second, third, and fourth ranked galaxies, we found that at earlier
times, fossil groups comprised two large brightest galaxies with similar
magnitudes surrounded by much fainter galaxies, while in control groups these
magnitude gaps were never as large as in fossils. At early times, fossil groups
in the faint population were denser than non-fossil groups, then this trend
reversed, and finally they became similar at the present day. The mean number
of faint galaxies in non-fossil systems increases in an almost constant rate
towards later times, while this number in fossil groups reaches a plateau at
$z\sim0.6$ that lasts $\sim 2$ Gyr, and then starts growing again more rapidly.
The formation of fossil groups is defined at the very beginning of the groups
according to their galaxy luminosity sampling, which could be determined by
their merging rate at early times.Comment: 10 pages, 6 figures, 1 table. Accepted for publication in Astronomy &
  Astrophysic We create a catalogue of simulated fossil groups and study their properties,
in particular the merging histories of their first-ranked galaxies. We compare
the simulated fossil group properties with those of both simulated non-fossil
and observed fossil groups. Using simulations and a mock galaxy catalogue, we
searched for massive ($>$ 5 $\times$ 10$^{13} h^{-1} {\cal M}_\odot$) fossil
groups in the Millennium Simulation Galaxy Catalogue. In addition, attempted to
identify observed fossil groups in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey Data Release 6
using identical selection criteria. Our predictions on the basis of the
simulation data are:(a) fossil groups comprise about 5.5% of the total
population of groups/clusters with masses larger than 5 x 10$^{13} h^{-1} {\cal
M}_\odot$. This fraction is consistent with the fraction of fossil groups
identified in the SDSS, after all observational biases have been taken into
account; (b) about 88% of the dominant central objects in fossil groups are
elliptical galaxies that have a median R-band absolute magnitude of $\sim
-23.5-5 log h$, which is typical of the observed fossil groups known in the
literature; (c)first-ranked galaxies of systems with $ {\cal M} >$ 5 x 10$^{13}
h^{-1} {\cal M}_\odot$, regardless of whether they are either fossil or
non-fossil, are mainly formed by gas-poor mergers; (d) although fossil groups,
in general, assembled most of their virial masses at higher redshifts in
comparison with non-fossil groups, first-ranked galaxies in fossil groups
merged later, i.e. at lower redshifts, compared with their non-fossil-group
counterparts. We therefore expect to observe a number of luminous galaxies in
the centres of fossil groups that show signs of a recent major merger.Comment: 9 pages, 3 figures, accepted for publication in Astronomy &
  Astrophysic Orangutans (Pongo) are the only great ape genus with a substantial Pleistocene and Holocene fossil record, demonstrating a much larger geographic range than extant populations. In addition to having an extensive fossil record, Pongo shows several convergent morphological similarities with Homo, including a trend of dental reduction during the past million years. While studies have documented variation in dental tissue proportions among species of Homo, little is known about variation in enamel thickness within fossil orangutans. Here we assess dental tissue proportions, including conventional enamel thickness indices, in a large sample of fossil orangutan postcanine teeth from mainland Asia and Indonesia. We find few differences between regions, except for significantly lower average enamel thickness (AET) values in Indonesian mandibular first molars. Differences between fossil and extant orangutans are more marked, with fossil Pongo showing higher AET in most postcanine teeth. These differences are significant for maxillary and mandibular first molars. Fossil orangutans show higher AET than extant Pongo due to greater enamel cap areas, which exceed increases in enamel-dentine junction length (due to geometric scaling of areas and lengths for the AET index calculation). We also find greater dentine areas in fossil orangutans, but relative enamel thickness indices do not differ between fossil and extant taxa. When changes in dental tissue proportions between fossil and extant orangutans are compared with fossil and recent Homo sapiens, Pongo appears to show isometric reduction in enamel and dentine, while crown reduction in H. sapiens appears to be due to preferential loss of dentine. Disparate selective pressures or developmental constraints may underlie these patterns. Finally, the finding of moderately thick molar enamel in fossil orangutans may represent an additional convergent dental similarity with Homo erectus, complicating attempts to distinguish these taxa in mixed Asian faunas"	['17183793', '18053700', '17183772', '24742406', '612334', '6104228']	"[[{'name': 'Aguerri, J.

the quantification of the amount of independent signal in a phylogenetically

methods for assessing the quality of a Monte Carlo approximation of a given
distribution and of related integrals. In this paper, we revisit and complete
the approximation of the ESS in the specific context of importance sampling
(IS). The derivation of this approximation, that we will denote as
$\widehat{\text{ESS}}$, is only partially available in Kong [1992]. This
approximation has been widely used in the last 25 years due to its simplicity
as a practical rule of thumb in a wide variety of importance sampling methods.
However, we show that the multiple assumptions and approximations in the
derivation of $\widehat{\text{ESS}}$, makes it difficult to be considered even
as a reasonable approximation of the ESS. We extend the discussion of the ESS
in the multiple importance sampling (MIS) setting, and we display numerical
examples. This paper does not cover the use of ESS for MCMC algorithms Sample correlations converge to the population value with increasing sample size, but the estimates are often inaccurate in small samples. In this report we use Monte-Carlo simulations to determine the critical sample size from which on the magnitude of a correlation can be expected to be stable. The necessary sample size to achieve stable estimates for correlations depends on the effect size, the width of the corridor of stability (i.e., a corridor around the true value where deviations are tolerated), and the requested confidence that the trajectory does not leave this corridor any more.

We assess pneumococcal carriage from studies conducted in sub-Saharan Africa (sSA) before and after the pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV) era. METHODS: A search for pneumococcal carriage studies published before 2012 was conducted to describe carriage in sSA. The review also describes pneumococcal serotypes and assesses the impact of vaccination on carriage in this region. RESULTS: Fifty-seven studies were included in this review with the majority (40.3%) from South Africa. There was considerable variability in the prevalence of carriage between studies (I-squared statistic = 99%). Carriage was higher in children and decreased with increasing age, 63.2% (95% CI: 55.6-70.8) in children less than 5 years, 42.6% (95% CI: 29.9-55.4) in children 5-15 years and 28.0% (95% CI: 19.0-37.0) in adults older than 15 years. There was no difference in the prevalence of carriage between males and females in 9/11 studies. Serotypes 19F, 6B, 6A, 14 and 23F were the five most common isolates. A meta-analysis of four randomized trials of PCV vaccination in children aged 9-24 months showed that carriage of vaccine type (VT) serotypes decreased with PCV vaccination; however, overall carriage remained the same because of a concomitant increase in non-vaccine type (NVT) serotypes. CONCLUSION: Pneumococcal carriage is generally high in the African continent, particularly in young children. The five most common serotypes in sSA are among the top seven serotypes that cause invasive pneumococcal disease in children globally. These serotypes are covered by the two PCVs recommended for routine childhood immunization by the WHO. The distribution of serotypes found in the nasopharynx is altered by PCV vaccination Lipoproteins are an important class of surface associated proteins that have diverse roles and frequently are involved in the virulence of bacterial pathogens. As prolipoproteins are attached to the cell membrane by a single enzyme, prolipoprotein diacylglyceryl transferase (Lgt), deletion of the corresponding gene potentially allows the characterisation of the overall importance of lipoproteins for specific bacterial functions. We have used a Δlgt mutant strain of Streptococcus pneumoniae to investigate the effects of loss of lipoprotein attachment on cation acquisition, growth in media containing specific carbon sources, and virulence in different infection models. Immunoblots of triton X-114 extracts, flow cytometry and immuno-fluorescence microscopy confirmed the Δlgt mutant had markedly reduced lipoprotein expression on the cell surface. The Δlgt mutant had reduced growth in cation depleted medium, increased sensitivity to oxidative stress, reduced zinc uptake, and reduced intracellular levels of several cations. Doubling time of the Δlgt mutant was also increased slightly when grown in medium with glucose, raffinose and maltotriose as sole carbon sources. These multiple defects in cation and sugar ABC transporter function for the Δlgt mutant were associated with only slightly delayed growth in complete medium. However the Δlgt mutant had significantly reduced growth in blood or bronchoalveolar lavage fluid and a marked impairment in virulence in mouse models of nasopharyngeal colonisation, sepsis and pneumonia. These data suggest that for S. pneumoniae loss of surface localisation of lipoproteins has widespread effects on ABC transporter functions that collectively prevent the Δlgt mutant from establishing invasive infection Streptococcus pneumoniae causes invasive infections, primarily at the extremes of life. A seven-valent conjugate vaccine (PCV7) is used to protect against invasive pneumococcal disease in children. Within three years of PCV7 introduction, we observed a fourfold increase in serotype 6C carriage, predominantly due to a single clone. We determined the whole-genome sequences of nineteen S. pneumoniae serotype 6C isolates, from both carriage (n = 15) and disease (n = 4) states, to investigate the emergence of serotype 6C in our population, focusing on a single multi-locus sequence type (MLST) clonal complex 395 (CC395). A phylogenetic network was constructed to identify different lineages, followed by analysis of variability in gene sets and sequences. Serotype 6C isolates from this single geographical site fell into four broad phylogenetically distinct lineages. Variation was seen in the 6C capsular locus and in sequences of genes encoding surface proteins. The largest clonal complex was characterised by the presence of lantibiotic synthesis locus. In our population, the 6C capsular locus has been introduced into multiple lineages by independent capsular switching events. However, rapid clonal expansion has occurred within a single MLST clonal complex. Worryingly, plasticity exists within current and potential vaccine-associated loci, a consideration for future vaccine use, target selection and design Streptococcus pneumoniae is a leading cause of pneumonia, meningitis, and bacteremia, estimated to cause 2 million deaths annually. The majority of pneumococcal mortality occurs in developing countries, with serotype 1 a leading cause in these areas. To begin to better understand the larger impact that serotype 1 strains have in developing countries, we characterized virulence and genetic content of PNI0373, a serotype 1 strain from a diseased patient in The Gambia. PNI0373 and another African serotype 1 strain showed high virulence in a mouse intraperitoneal challenge model, with 20% survival at a dose of 1 cfu. The PNI0373 genome sequence was similar in structure to other pneumococci, with the exception of a 100 kb inversion. PNI0373 showed only15 lineage specific CDS when compared to the pan-genome of pneumococcus. However analysis of non-core orthologs of pneumococcal genomes, showed serotype 1 strains to be closely related. Three regions were found to be serotype 1 associated and likely products of horizontal gene transfer. A detailed inventory of known virulence factors showed that some functions associated with colonization were absent, consistent with the observation that carriage of this highly virulent serotype is unusual. The African serotype 1 strains thus appear to be closely related to each other and different from other pneumococci despite similar genetic content Segregation of replicated chromosomes is an essential process in all organisms. How bacteria, such as the oval-shaped human pathogen Streptococcus pneumoniae, efficiently segregate their chromosomes is poorly understood. Here we show that the pneumococcal homologue of the DNA-binding protein ParB recruits S. pneumoniae condensin (SMC) to centromere-like DNA sequences (parS) that are located near the origin of replication, in a similar fashion as was shown for the rod-shaped model bacterium Bacillus subtilis. In contrast to B. subtilis, smc is not essential in S. pneumoniae, and Δsmc cells do not show an increased sensitivity to gyrase inhibitors or high temperatures. However, deletion of smc and/or parB results in a mild chromosome segregation defect. Our results show that S. pneumoniae contains a functional chromosome segregation machine that promotes efficient chromosome segregation by recruitment of SMC via ParB. Intriguingly, the data indicate that other, as of yet unknown mechanisms, are at play to ensure proper chromosome segregation in this organism.

e9fbe8f1-b4ab-4988-a8a8-c146ebcae0a1	courtship	Alternative pre-mRNA splicing (AS) is a critical regulatory mechanism that operates extensively in the nervous system to produce diverse protein isoforms. Fruitless AS isoforms have been shown to influence male courtship behavior, but the underlying mechanisms are unknown. Using genome-wide approaches and quantitative behavioral assays, we show that the P-element somatic inhibitor (PSI) and its interaction with the U1 small nuclear ribonucleoprotein complex (snRNP) control male courtship behavior. PSI mutants lacking the U1 snRNP-interacting domain (PSIΔAB mutant) exhibit extended but futile mating attempts. The PSIΔAB mutant results in significant changes in the AS patterns of ∼1,200 genes in the Drosophila brain, many of which have been implicated in the regulation of male courtship behavior. PSI directly regulates the AS of at least one-third of these transcripts, suggesting that PSI-U1 snRNP interactions coordinate the behavioral network underlying courtship behavior. Importantly, one of these direct targets is fruitless, the master regulator of courtship. Thus, PSI imposes a specific mode of regulatory control within the neuronal circuit controlling courtship, even though it is broadly expressed in the fly nervous system. This study reinforces the importance of AS in the control of gene activity in neurons and integrated neuronal circuits, and provides a surprising link between a pleiotropic pre-mRNA splicing pathway and the precise control of successful male mating behavior Acoustic signals play an important role in premating isolation based on sexual selection within many taxa. Many male parasitic wasps produce characteristic courtship songs used by females in mate selection. In Cotesia (Hymenoptera: Braconidae: Microgastrinae), courtship songs are generated by wing fanning with repetitive pulses in stereotypical patterns. Our objectives were to sample the diversity of courtship songs within Cotesia and to identify underlying patterns of differentiation. We compared songs among 12 of ca. 80 Cotesia species in North America, including ten species that have not been recorded previously. For Cotesia congregata, we compared songs of wasps originating from six different host-foodplant sources, two of which are considered incipient species. Songs of emergent males from wild caterpillar hosts in five different families were recorded, and pattern, frequency, and duration of song elements analyzed. Principal component analysis converted the seven elements characterized into four uncorrelated components used in a hierarchical cluster analysis and grouped species by similarity of song structure. Species songs varied significantly in duration of repeating pulse and buzz elements and/or in fundamental frequency. Cluster analysis resolved similar species groups in agreement with the most recent molecular phylogeny for Cotesia spp., indicating the potential for using courtship songs as a predictor of genetic relatedness. Courtship song analysis may aid in identifying closely related cryptic species that overlap spatially, and provide insight into the evolution of this highly diverse and agriculturally important taxon Pollimyrus isidori's electric organ discharge (EOD) is of the pulse type. Patterns of EOD intervals were investigated prior to, during and following spawning behaviors as related with overt behaviors, and with the sound production by the nestbuilding male. Prior to the time of reproduction, isolated and socially interacting fish (n=15) showed characteristic discharge interval patterns for resting, swimming, probing, hovering and hiding activities. Males (n=8) and females (n=6) did not differ in their mean EOD repetition rates during resting (11.6±2.5 Hz), nor Short Bursts/min (less than 20 intervals of 8–13 ms). In interacting fish Long Bursts (greater than 20 intervals of 8–13 ms, lasting for more than 300 ms) were observed only during the attack and bite sequence. A pursuing fish displayed a rapid alternation of Long Bursts with Discharge Breaks (300–1000 ms silence) during the chase behavior. Avoidance behavior which followed from several attacks was correlated with a Medium Uniform Rate (8–12 Hz) normally lasting for 20 to 60 s, or a Discharge Arrest (silence greater than 1 s) in the submissive fish. The nocturnal courtship behavior began soon after dark (1900 h). Spawning typically started 2 to 5 h after dark, continuing for 2 to 6 h until about 0200 h. During courtship and spawning the female's brief visits (15–25 s) to the male's territory recurred every 30–60 s. At all other times the female was aggressively excluded from the nest region. Courtship and spawning behaviors are described along with the electrical displays identified from 19 spawnings in three fish pairs (from a total of 37 spawnings in 4 males and 4 females). Just prior to the onset of courtship behavior, with male territorial aggression beginning to decline, females switched from a Medium Sporadic Rate pattern (resting and hiding patterns; 13 Hz) to a Medium Uniform Rate pattern (6–8 Hz) while still in their hiding area. Females continued to display this uniform rate throughout the courship and spawning period, including the courtship and spawning bouts when Discharge Breaks or Arrests also occurred. This persistance distinguishes the courtship pattern from the similar avoidance pattern (see above). The male courtship and spawning EOD pattern was similar to the female's and unique for a territorial male. He switched from a High Sporadic Rate (swimming EOD pattern; about 18 Hz) to a regularized Medium Uniform Rate (about 9 to 11 Hz) only during courtship and spawning bouts, including 1–3 EOD Breaks during Vent-to-Vent coupling (average interval: 272±71 ms, n=37). No sooner had the female left the spawning site than he resumed displaying a High Sporadic Rate. This temporal correlation of reproductive behaviors with electrical displays suggests their instrumental role in mutual acceptance of mates. Males showed their sex-specific type of EOD phase-locking, the Preferred Latency Response, only during the first few hours of entry of a fish in their tank. Two females with EOD waveform features more typical of males also spawned repeatedly; waveform does not appear to be critical. Males stopped their nocturnal sound production for the later part of courtship and the whole spawning period. Except for infrequent attacks on the female between spawning bouts, the male did not resume singing until the end of spawning when all eggs were shed (around 0200 h); from this time on the male sang until dawn. The sequencing of the three acoustic elements (moans, grunts, growls) are described. A catalogue of discharge patterns correlated with overt behaviors (Tables 1, 2), and an integrated summary time table of P. isidori's complex reproductive behavior are presented Twelve students at the University of Texas at Austin have been interviewed in an attempt to understand romantic love and courtship on the college campus. Romantic love and courtship on UT campus are best understood through the conceptualization of college as a liminal period. Students are expressing liminality in their ambiguous and unstructured behaviors and perceptions of courtship, and their rendition of romantic love as irreconcilable on the college campus. Romantic love is thus conceptualized as the ‘structured result’ of ‘the activity which has no structure’ that is college courtship. It is through this activity with no structure that students learn and perpetuate their ideal romantic love that they will seek out after the liminal period, that ultimately structures them into marriage and family units.Anthropolog Following the interviews of 24 participants concerning the death of their spouse and subsequent remarriage, a pattern of unsolicited responses concerning perceived acceptance of family emerged. Through grounded theory qualitative analysis, a continuum of acceptance was developed ranging from welcoming acceptance to active disapproval. Themes that influenced the perceived level of acceptance were (a) the length of time between death and courtship; (b) the length of the courtship itself; and (c) the level of family involvement in the courtship. Findings support and enhance current literature on remarital adjustment, suggesting it is critical to not only include children, but also the extended family in which the family resides. Provisional hypotheses and clinical implications are provided to help clinicians navigate these complex family dynamics and potentially increase family support	['81791284', '68371010', '25812574', '33903702', '40374916']	[[{'name': 'Hilgers, V.'}, {'name': 'Klibaite, U.'}, {'name': 'Rio, D.'}, {'name': 'Shaevitz, J.'}, {'name': 'Taliaferro, J.'}, {'name': 'Wang, Q.'}], [{'name': 'Bredlau, Justin P.'}, {'name': 'Kester, Karen M.'}], [{'name': 'Bratton, Bradford O.'}, {'name': 'Kramer, Bernd'}], [{'name': 'Gomez, Paulina'}], [{'name': 'Engblom-Deglmann, Michelle'}]]	['The PSI-U1 snRNP interaction regulates male mating behavior in Drosophila', 'Evolutionary Relationships of Courtship Songs in the Parasitic Wasp Genus, Cotesia (Hymenoptera: Braconidae)', 'Patterns of the electric organ discharge during courtship and spawning in the mormyrid fish, Pollimyrus isidori', 'Love and Liminality: Understanding College as a Liminal Phase in regards to Romantic Love and Courtship', 'Not Even Cold in Her Grave: How Postbereavement Remarried Couples Perceive Family Acceptance']	5.0	exploratory	0.5
cc4ba794-709d-4a9e-9a6b-356f4e8946c5	psychology	Immersive virtual reality systems employing head-mounted displays offer great promise for the investigation of perception and action, but there are well-documented limitations to most virtual reality systems. In the present article, we suggest strategies for studying perception/action interactions that try to depend on both scale-invariant metrics (such as power function exponents) and careful consideration of the requirements of the interactions under investigation. New data concerning the effect of pincushion distortion on the perception of surface orientation are presented, as well as data documenting the perception of dynamic distortions associated with head movements with uncorrected optics. A review of several successful uses of virtual reality to study the interaction of perception and action emphasizes scale-free analysis strategies that can achieve theoretical goals while minimizing assumptions about the accuracy of virtual simulations “Let your home know where your heart is.” (Billboard advertisement for cellular phone) The setting is a retirement home for the elderly. Wilfred enters the veranda in search of two close friends. He is in luck, they are both present. But alas, one is lost to her Walkman and the other is engrossed in his book. Neither notices Wilfred\u27s presence. Frustrated, Wilfred is left to stare silently into space. Such is the beginning of Ronald Harwood\u27s London play, Quartet. Young or old, we instantly identify with the scene. How often do we enter a room to find family, friends or colleagues absorbed by their computer screen, television, CDs, telephone, newspaper, or even a book? Perhaps they welcome us without hesitation; but sometimes there is a pause, accompanied even by a look of slight irritation. And at times our presence may go completely unacknowledged. We are present but simultaneously rendered absent; we have been erased by an absent presence. It is the twentieth-century expansion of absent presence that I wish to explore in what follows. My concern is with the growing domain of diverted or divided consciousness invited by communication technology, and most particularly the mobile telephone. One is physically present but is absorbed by a technologically mediated world of elsewhere. Typically it is a world of relationships, both active and vicarious, within which domains of meaning are being created or sustained This paper emerges from an attempt to shift the locus of understanding human action from the individual to relationship. In doing so we come to see persons as multi-beings, that is, as constituted within multiple relationships from which they emerge with multiple, incoherent, and often conflicting potentials. Therapy, in this context, becomes a collaborative relationship with the aim of transforming the client\u27s broader relational network. In this view, schooling in a singular practice of therapy artificially limits the therapist\u27s potential, and thus the possible outcomes of the client–therapist relationship. Invited, then, is a reflective eclecticism, in which the myriad potentials of both the therapist and client are considered in tandem. This view is illustrated by contrasting three relational conditions in which clients find themselves, each of which invites a different form of self-expression from the therapist This chapter opens with a social constructionist perspective on human essences. As proposed, essences are not given in nature, but constructed within cultural traditions. Thus, the major challenge is not that of “getting it right” about the essence, but generating accounts that may contribute to society. A criterion of reflective pragmatism is proposed in which questions of contribution and critique prevail. In this light the chapter places in critical light the bio-cognitive and neurological explanations of human nature, especially focusing on the ideological and political implications of these orientations. In contrast, discussion opens on relational conceptions of human essence. Several approaches are considered, including symbolic interactionism and object relations theory in psychoanalysis. However, a fully relational account abandons the individual as the fundamental unit of analysis in favor of relational process out of which the very conception of the individual is formed (or not). Several practical implications are treated including the potentials of relational responsibilit Genetics and the biological sciences are the two contemporary scientific fields most readily called to mind in thinking about science and eugenics. Yet the history of another discipline, psychology, is enmeshed more intricately with eugenics than are the histories of either genetics or even the biological sciences more generally. This is true of the history of eugenics in Canada. Moreover, continuities in the roles that psychology plays in how we think about sorts of people and their ability and right to parent make psychology’s eugenic past relevant to reflection on contemporary and ongoing practices and policies People routinely remember events that have passed and imagine those that are yet to come. The past and the future are sometimes psychologically close ( just around the corner ) and other times psychologically distant ( ages away ). Four studies demonstrate a systematic asymmetry whereby future events are psychologically closer than past events of equivalent objective distance. When considering specific times (e.g., 1 year) or events (e.g., Valentine\u27s Day), people consistently reported that the future was closer than the past. We suggest that this asymmetry arises because the subjective experience of movement through time (whereby future events approach and past events recede) is analogous to the physical experience of movement through space. Consistent with this hypothesis, experimentally reversing the metaphorical arrow of time (by having participants move backward through virtual space) completely eliminated the past-future asymmetry. We discuss how reducing psychological distance to the future may function to prepare people for upcoming action	['37590808', '42984857', '38148314', '38148006', '42984837', '50068867', '38148153', '8865021', '37585330', '37588738', '38148252', '37593463']	[[{'name': 'Durgin, Frank H.'}, {'name': 'Li, Z.'}], [{'name': 'Marecek, Jeanne'}], [{'name': 'Gergen, Kenneth J.'}], [{'name': 'Durgin, Frank H.'}], [{'name': 'Anderson'}, {'name': 'Becvar'}, {'name': 'Claude-Pierre'}, {'name': 'Cronen'}, {'name': 'Gergen'}, {'name': 'Kelly'}, {'name': 'Koshikawa'}, {'name': 'Lecky'}, {'name': 'Penn'}, {'name': 'Rogers'}, {'name': 'Schwartz'}, {'name': 'Spence'}, {'name': 'Sullivan'}, {'name': 'Tomm'}, {'name': 'Toulmin'}, {'name': 'White'}], [{'name': 'Gergen, Kenneth J.'}], [{'name': 'Gergen, Kenneth J.'}, {'name': 'Gergen, M.

8fa47c97-da68-466f-9a62-714cddc1ad00	rest	This paper investigates whether unions, through imposing wage floors that lead to wage compression, increase on-the-job training. Our analysis focuses on Germany. Based on a model of unions and firm-financed training, we derive empirical implications regarding apprenticeship training intensity, layoffs, wage cuts, and wage compression in unionized and nonunionized firms. We test these implications using firm panel data matched with administrative employee data. We find support for the hypothesis that union recognition, via imposing minimum wages and wage compression, increases training in apprenticeship programs This paper contributes to a long-lasting debate between practitioners who argue that academia is unable to understand what pricing is all about and academics who criticize practitioner pricing approaches for lacking rigor or rationality. The paper conceptualizes a resource-advantage (R-A) perspective on pricing by drawing on the R-A theory of competition. After a review of R-A theory, the paper integrates the price discretion concept and pricing as a spanning competence by introducing a separation between resources that create and resources that extract value, thereby expanding R-A theory to pricing. The perspective aims to shed light on how the process of competition helps organizations to learn/benefit from pricing capabilities. The research shifts the focus of pricing research from an equilibrium-based static view to a dynamic, disequilibrium-provoking pricing competence. In this way, it draws attention to what is perhaps most relevant to pricing in practice: the actual means necessary to determine price This paper develops and validates experimentally a feedback strategy for the reduction of the link deformations in rest-to-rest motion of mechanisms with flexible links, named Delayed Reference Control (DRC). The technique takes advantage of the inertial coupling between rigid-bodymotion and elasticmotion to control the undesired link deformations by shifting in time the position reference through an action reference parameter. The action reference parameter is computed on the fly based on the sensed strains by solving analytically an optimization problem. An outer control loop is closed to compute the references for the position controllers of each actuator, which can be thought of as the inner control loop. The resulting multiloop architecture of the DRC is a relevant advantage over several traditional feedback controllers: DRC can be implemented by just adding an outer control loop to standard position controllers. A validation of the proposed control strategy is provided by applying the DRC to the real-time control of a four-bar linkage	['539324', '26554131', '52984790', '8698026']	[[{'name': 'Beckmann Michael'}, {'name': 'Bispinck Reinhard'}, {'name': 'Böheim Rene'}, {'name': 'Christian Dustmann'}, {'name': 'Kölling Arndt'}, {'name': 'Medoff James L'}, {'name': 'Stevens Margaret'}, {'name': 'Uta Schönberg'}], [{'name': 'Roper, Angela'}, {'name': 'van der Rest, Jean-Pierre'}], [{'name': 'Caracciolo, Roberto'}, {'name': 'Richiedei, Dario'}, {'name': 'Trevisani, Alberto'}], [{'name': 'Rossiter, William'}]]	"['Training and Union wages', 'A resource-advantage perspective on pricing: shifting the focus from ends to means-end in pricing research?', 'Deformation Control in Rest-to-Rest Motion of Mechanisms with Flexible Links', ""What Wyatt Really Did to Aretino's Sette Salmi""]"	4.0	navigational	0.8198360296441437

ae841c9c-cc1a-4340-bacf-4b7bdfaa1664	generative ai	"Data science has become increasingly popular due to emerging technologies, including generative AI, big data, deep learning, etc. It can provide insights from data that are hard to determine from a human perspective. Data science in finance helps to provide more personal and safer experiences for customers and develop cutting-edge solutions for a company. This paper surveys the challenges and opportunities in applying data science to finance. It provides a state-of-the-art review of financial technologies, algorithmic trading, and fraud detection. Also, the paper identifies two research topics. One is how to use generative AI in algorithmic trading. The other is how to apply it to fraud detection. Last but not least, the paper discusses the challenges posed by generative AI, such as the ethical considerations, potential biases, and data security A demonstration of several AI tools, including ChatGPT, ChatPDF, Consensus, and more. The focus of the session is on potential student uses of the tools and related library initiatives, so we address the limits of ChatGPT as an information source. Librarians can help students learn how to use these tools responsibly and provide leadership on campus as AI is integrated into assignments The rise of generative AI has led many companies to hire freelancers to harness its potential. However, this technology presents unique challenges to developers who have not previously engaged with it. Freelancers may find these challenges daunting due to the absence of organizational support and their reliance on positive client feedback. In a study involving 52 freelance developers, we identified multiple challenges associated with developing solutions based on generative AI. Freelancers often struggle with aspects they perceive as unique to generative AI such as unpredictability of its output, the occurrence of hallucinations, and the inconsistent effort required due to trial-and-error prompting cycles. Further, the limitations of specific frameworks, such as token limits and long response times, add to the complexity. Hype-related issues, such as inflated client expectations and a rapidly evolving technological ecosystem, further exacerbate the difficulties. To address these issues, we propose Software Engineering for Generative AI (SE4GenAI) and Hype-Induced Software Engineering (HypeSE) as areas where the software engineering community can provide effective guidance. This support is essential for freelancers working with generative AI and other emerging technologies Transformative artificially intelligent tools, such as ChatGPT, designed to generate sophisticated text indistinguishable from that produced by a human, are applicable across a wide range of contexts. The technology presents opportunities as well as, often ethical and legal, challenges, and has the potential for both positive and negative impacts for organisations, society, and individuals. Offering multi-disciplinary insight into some of these, this article brings together 43 contributions from experts in fields such as computer science, marketing, information systems, education, policy, hospitality and tourism, management, publishing, and nursing. The contributors acknowledge ChatGPT's capabilities to enhance productivity and suggest that it is likely to offer significant gains in the banking, hospitality and tourism, and information technology industries, and enhance business activities, such as management and marketing. Nevertheless, they also consider its limitations, disruptions to practices, threats to privacy and security, and consequences of biases, misuse, and misinformation. However, opinion is split on whether ChatGPT's use should be restricted or legislated. Drawing on these contributions, the article identifies questions requiring further research across three thematic areas: knowledge, transparency, and ethics; digital transformation of organisations and societies; and teaching, learning, and scholarly research. The avenues for further research include: identifying skills, resources, and capabilities needed to handle generative AI; examining biases of generative AI attributable to training datasets and processes; exploring business and societal contexts best suited for generative AI implementation; determining optimal combinations of human and generative AI for various tasks; identifying ways to assess accuracy of text produced by generative AI; and uncovering the ethical and legal issues in using generative AI across different contexts Generative AI applications present unique design challenges. As generative AI
technologies are increasingly being incorporated into mainstream applications,
there is an urgent need for guidance on how to design user experiences that
foster effective and safe use. We present six principles for the design of
generative AI applications that address unique characteristics of generative AI
UX and offer new interpretations and extensions of known issues in the design
of AI applications. Each principle is coupled with a set of design strategies
for implementing that principle via UX capabilities or through the design
process. The principles and strategies were developed through an iterative
process involving literature review, feedback from design practitioners,
validation against real-world generative AI applications, and incorporation
into the design process of two generative AI applications. We anticipate the
principles to usefully inform the design of generative AI applications by
driving actionable design recommendations.Comment: 34 pages, 4 figures. To be published in CHI 202 Much of the existing literature on generative AI applications is conflicting, with findings suggesting that investing in AI will lead to better organizational outcomes but also pointing out that incorporating AI may be a wasteful even counterproductive initiative. We develop a conceptual frame-work to characterize generative AI benefits based on the types of tasks that generative AI may be used for in management. Our work suggests that task creativity plays a key role in successful generative AI outcomes, but human validation - the extent to which a human engages in a supervisory role - is required to reap the benefits. Our conceptual framework is focused on white collar jobs and suggests that the management of generative AI is a strategic choice with important managerial implications This paper reports preliminary findings from an ongoing, campus wide research project on effective methods for generative AI applicability in pursuit of effective and engaging teaching and learning activities. Generative AI has had a tremendous adoption rate since the public release of ChatGPT 3.5 on November 30th 2022. This has necessitated that educators and administrators consider the potential opportunities and threats usage of generative AI by students and faculty may have on higher education. Recognizing the inevitability of generative AI, the researchers have proposed a university-wide research project to ascertain the changes in faculty and students perspectives when using generative AI The research project is two-fold. First, a longitudinal survey has been developed to address research questions about usage and perceptions of generative AI change over time.
The second prong of this research project focuses on the implementation of new and continuing generative AI professional development workshops. These “AI Institutes” are targeted educational opportunities to provide faculty, staff, and students with hands-on experiences that model appropriate ways to teach and learn with generative AI tools. Workshops change based on audience needs, but will be designed to support such processes as introductory and advanced lessons on building learning activities which engage students with generative AI, administrative shortcuts, best practices for writing, and our university’s AI policy and principles.
The longitudinal survey, thus, allows the research team to gauge changes in perspectives as the “AI Institutes'' are deployed and widespread adoption of generative AI tools become more mainstream. This paper reports on the first year of this research project, including one survey and one AI Institute.
This research on integrating generative AI technologies into teaching and learning has important implications for the field of networked learning. As the paper explores, rapid advances in AI are changing how students and faculty interact with content and each other. Findings from the longitudinal survey and AI Institutes could provide insights into how to thoughtfully leverage these emerging tools to enhance connections, dialogue, collaboration, and co-creation of knowledge within digital learning networks. 
While further research is needed, this project takes an important first step in assessing faculty and student perceptions that can inform appropriate AI integration. Lessons learned could guide other institutions exploring the potentials and pitfalls of weaving generative AI into networked learning ecosystems Open Access funding enabled and organized by Projekt DEAL.Ludwig-Maximilians-Universität München (1024 This study applies Activity Theory to investigate how English as a foreign
language (EFL) students prompt generative artificial intelligence (AI) tools
during short story writing. Sixty-seven Hong Kong secondary school students
created generative-AI tools using open-source language models and wrote short
stories with them. The study collected and analyzed the students' generative-AI
tools, short stories, and written reflections on their conditions or purposes
for prompting. The research identified three main themes regarding the purposes
for which students prompt generative-AI tools during short story writing: a
lack of awareness of purposes, overcoming writer's block, and developing,
expanding, and improving the story. The study also identified common
characteristics of students' activity systems, including the sophistication of
their generative-AI tools, the quality of their stories, and their school's
overall academic achievement level, for their prompting of generative-AI tools
for the three purposes during short story writing. The study's findings suggest
that teachers should be aware of students' purposes for prompting generative-AI
tools to provide tailored instructions and scaffolded guidance. The findings
may also help designers provide differentiated instructions for users at
various levels of story development when using a generative-AI tool.Comment: 38 pages, 9 figure The rise of generative artificial intelligence (AI) has sparked concerns
about its potential influence on unemployment and market depression. This study
addresses this concern by examining the impact of generative AI on product
markets. To overcome the challenge of causal inference, given the inherent
limitations of conducting controlled experiments, this paper identifies an
unanticipated and sudden leak of a highly proficient image-generative AI as a
novel instance of a ""natural experiment"". This AI leak spread rapidly,
significantly reducing the cost of generating anime-style images compared to
other styles, creating an opportunity for comparative assessment. We collect
real-world data from an artwork outsourcing platform. Surprisingly, our results
show that while generative AI lowers average prices, it substantially boosts
order volume and overall revenue. This counterintuitive finding suggests that
generative AI confers benefits upon artists rather than detriments. The study
further offers theoretical economic explanations to elucidate this unexpected
phenomenon. By furnishing empirical evidence, this paper dispels the notion
that generative AI might engender depression, instead underscoring its
potential to foster market prosperity. These findings carry significant
implications for practitioners, policymakers, and the broader AI community How can librarians support students in exploring the use of generative AI to aid in the research process? This presentation will discuss a partnership between an academic librarian and an English faculty at a comprehensive state university in fall 2023 and spring 2024. In two sections of a 300-level major English course, students are required to use generative AI for an assignment. The collaboration consists of two information literacy sessions that utilize scaffolded activities. The first session focuses on students using generative AI to aid in their research process. We discuss their experiences using generative AI tools, develop an understanding of how generative AI works, and test four generative AI tools (ChatGPT, Google Gemini, Bing Copilot and Perplexity). The second session focuses on building more traditional research skills. Students practice how to break an AI generated thesis statement into keywords and use library databases to find peer-reviewed articles. The presenter will share observations from introducing students to generative AI tools including common student reactions and critiques. Throughout the presentation, session participants will reflect on ways they could collaborate with course instructors to discuss generative AI with students in a critical and non-punitive way. Participants will leave with a practical example of how to talk with students about using generative AI tools in the research process Artificial intelligence (AI) has seen rapid development in recent years and has increasingly been applied to various fields. Research is no exception. However, there is much to be explored in this domain. This study aims to explore the suitability of current generative AI applications for research purposes. The focus is on the generative AI’s capability to synthesise information as a potential alternative or supplement to human-based information synthesisation. In order to evaluate the effectiveness of the thematic analysis produced by generative AI, this study compares the generative AI-produced results by ChatGPT with human-generated results, based on the same set of papers. The results show generative AI produced very similar results to humans, in terms of the topics themselves and the number of topics identified. However, there are also some minor mismatches between generative AI and human results Prompt literacy signifies a major leap in education, offering a potent tool to interact with generative AI systems. As an emerging necessity in the 21st century and beyond, it encompasses the formulation, interpretation, and analysis of AI prompts. Poised to be foundational for all future generations, this discourse brings to light its emergence in parallel with generative AI and its transformative role in pedagogical contexts for the coming decades and beyond Artificial Intelligence has become a focal point of interest across various sectors due to its ability to generate creative and realistic outputs. A specific subset, generative artificial intelligence, has seen significant growth, particularly in late 2022. Tools like ChatGPT, Dall-E, or Midjourney have democratized access to Large Language Models, enabling the creation of human-like content. However, the concept 'Generative Artificial Intelligence lacks a universally accepted definition, leading to potential misunderstandings. While a model that produces any output can be technically seen as generative, the Artificial Intelligent research community often reserves the term for complex models that generate high-quality, human-like material. This paper presents a literature mapping of AI-driven content generation, analyzing 631 solutions published over the last five years to better understand and characterize the Generative Artificial Intelligence landscape. Our findings suggest a dichotomy in the understanding and application of the term ""Generative AI"". While the broader public often interprets ""Generative AI"" as AI-driven creation of tangible content, the AI research community mainly discusses generative implementations with an emphasis on the models in use, without explicitly categorizing their work under the term ""Generative AI"""	['160461895', '148549245', '156687448', '155842806', '157267625', '161478847', '157857723', '156474478', '153491315', '143187780', '153740078', '160774909', '160619619', '149297283', '149204740']	"[[{'name': 'Chai, Sheng'}, {'name': 'Gildea, Elizabeth'}, {'name': 'Wang, Shuxi'}, {'name': 'Zhang, Tongxiao'}, {'name': 'Zheng, Xianrong'}], [{'name': 'Gustafson-Sundell, Nat'}, {'name': 'McCullough, Mark'}], [{'name': 'Dolata, Mateusz'}, {'name': 'Lange, Norbert'}, {'name': 'Schwabe, Gerhard'}], [{'name': 'Ahuja M.'}, {'name': 'Al-Busaidi A.

Objectives: To evaluate the safety and immunogenicity of a leading new TB vaccine, recombinant Modified Vaccinia Ankara expressing Antigen 85A (MVA85A) in individuals with LTBI.

Methods: An open-label, phase I trial of MVA85A was performed in 12 subjects with LTBI recruited from TB contact clinics in Oxford and London or by poster advertisements in Oxford hospitals. Patients were assessed clinically and had blood samples drawn for immunological analysis over a 52-week period after vaccination with MVA85A. Thoracic computed tomography scans were performed at baseline and at 10 weeks after vaccination. Safety of MVA85A was assessed by clinical, radiological, and inflammatory markers. The immunogenicity of MVA85A was assessed by IFNγ and IL-2 ELISpot assays and FACS.

Measurements and Main Results: MVA85A was safe in subjects with LTBI, with comparable adverse events to previous trials of MVA85A. There were no clinically significant changes in inflammatory markers or thoracic computed tomography scans after vaccination. MVA85A induced a strong antigen-specific IFN-γ and IL-2 response that was durable for 52 weeks. The magnitude of IFN-γ response was comparable to previous trials of MVA85A in bacillus Calmette-Guérin–vaccinated individuals. Antigen 85A–specific polyfunctional CD4+ T cells were detectable prior to vaccination with statistically significant increases in cell numbers after vaccination.

Conclusions: MVA85A is safe and highly immunogenic in individuals with LTBI. These results will facilitate further trials in TB-endemic areas.Oxford Biomedical Research Centre, Wellcome Trust, and AFTBVAC Molecular analyses of lung aspirates from Gambian children with severe pneumonia detected pathogens more frequently than did culture and showed a predominance of bacteria, principally Streptococcus pneumoniae, >75% being of serotypes covered by current pneumococcal conjugate vaccines. Multiple pathogens were detected frequently, notably Haemophilus influenzae (mostly nontypeable) together with S. pneumoniae BACKGROUND: Offspring of women with schistosomiasis may exhibit immune responsiveness to schistosomes due to in utero sensitisation or trans-placental transfer of antibodies. Praziquantel treatment during pregnancy boosts maternal immune responses to schistosome antigens and reduces worm burden. Effects of praziquantel treatment during pregnancy on responses among offspring are unknown. METHODS: In a trial of anthelminthic treatment during pregnancy in Uganda (ISRCTN32849447; http://www.controlled-trials.com/ISRCTN32849447/elliott), offspring of women with Schistosoma mansoni were examined for cytokine and antibody responses to schistosome worm (SWA) and egg (SEA) antigen, in cord blood and at age one year. Relationships to maternal responses and pre-treatment infection intensities were examined, and responses were compared between the offspring of women who did, or did not receive praziquantel treatment during pregnancy. RESULTS: Of 388 S. mansoni-infected women studied, samples were obtained at age one year from 215 of their infants. Stool examination for S. mansoni eggs was negative for all infants. Cord and infant samples were characterised by very low cytokine production in response to schistosome antigens with the exception of cord IL-10 responses, which were substantial. Cord and infant cytokine responses showed no association with maternal responses. As expected, cord blood levels of immunoglobulin (Ig) G to SWA and SEA were high and correlated with maternal antibodies. However, by age one year IgG levels had waned and were hardly detectable. Praziquantel treatment during pregnancy showed no effect on cytokine responses or antibodies levels to SWA or SEA either in cord blood or at age one year, except for IgG1 to SWA, which was elevated in infants of treated mothers, reflecting maternal levels. There was some evidence that maternal infection intensity was positively associated with cord blood IL-5 and IL-13 responses to SWA, and IL-5 responses to SEA, and that this association was modified by treatment with praziquantel. CONCLUSIONS: Despite strong effects on maternal infection intensity and maternal immune responses, praziquantel treatment of infected women during pregnancy had no effect on anti-schistosome immune responses among offspring by age one year. Whether the treatment will impact upon the offspring's responses on exposure to primary schistosome infection remains to be elucidated. TRIAL REGISTRATION: ISRCTN: ISRCTN32849447 UNLABELLED: To describe how, through a DSS in a rural area of The Gambia, it has been possible to measure substantial reductions in child mortality rates and how we investigated whether the decline paralleled the registered fall in malaria incidence in the country. METHODS: Demographic surveillance data spanning 19.5 years (1 April 1989-30 September 2008) from 42 villages around the town of Farafenni, The Gambia, were used to estimate childhood mortality rates for neonatal, infant, child (1-4 years) and under-5 age groups. Data were presented in five a priori defined time periods, and annual rates per 1000 live births were derived from Kaplan-Meier survival probabilities. RESULTS: From 1989-1992 to 2004-2008, under-5 mortality declined by 56% (95% CI: 48-63%), from 165 (95% CI: 151-181) per 1000 live births to 74 (95% CI: 65-84) per 1000 live births. In 1- to 4-year-olds, mortality during the period 2004-2008 was 69% (95% CI: 60-76%) less than in 1989-1992. The corresponding mortality decline in infants was 39% (95% CI: 23-52%); in neonates, it was 38% (95% CI: 13-66%). The derived annual under-5 mortality rates declined from 159 per 1000 live births in 1990 to 45 per 1000 live births in 2008, thus implying an attainment of MDG4 seven years in advance of the target year of 2015. CONCLUSION: Achieving MDG4 is possible in poor, rural areas of Africa through widespread deployment of relatively simple measures that improve child survival, such as immunisation and effective malaria control A number of different interferon-c ELISpot protocols are in use in laboratories studying antigen-specific immune responses. It is therefore unclear how results from different assays compare, and what factors most significantly influence assay outcome. One such difference is that some laboratories use a short in vitro stimulation period of cells before they are
transferred to the ELISpot plate; this is commonly done in the case of frozen cells, in order to enhance assay sensitivity.
Other differences that may be significant include antibody coating of plates, the use of media with or without serum, the serum source and the number of cells added to the wells. The aim of this paper was to identify which components of the different ELISpot protocols influenced assay sensitivity and inter-laboratory variation. Four laboratories provided protocols for quantifying numbers of interferon-c spot forming cells in human peripheral blood mononuclear cells stimulated with Mycobacterium tuberculosis derived antigens. The differences in the protocols were compared directly. We found that several sources of variation in assay protocols can be eliminated, for example by avoiding serum supplementation and using AIM-V serum free medium. In addition, the number of cells added to ELISpot wells should also be standardised. Importantly, delays in peripheral blood mononuclear cell processing before stimulation had a marked effect on the number of detectable spot forming cells; processing delay thus should be minimised as well as standardised. Finally, a pre-stimulation culture period improved the sensitivity of the assay, however this effect may be both antigen and donor dependent. In conclusion, small differences in ELISpot protocols in routine use can affect the results obtained and care should be given to conditions selected for use in a given study. A pre-stimulation step may improve the sensitivity of the assay, particularly when cells have been previously frozen Malaria sporozoites induce swift activation of antigen-specific CD8(+) T cells that inhibit the intracellular development of liver-stage parasites. The length of time of functional in vivo antigen presentation, estimated by monitoring the activation of antigen-specific CD8(+) T cells, is of short duration, with maximum T cell activation occurring within the first 8 h after immunization and lasting approximately 48 h. Although the magnitude of the CD8(+) T cell response closely correlates with the number of parasites used for immunization, increasing the time of antigen presentation by daily immunizations does not enhance the magnitude of this response. Thus, once a primary clonal burst is established, the CD8(+) T cell response becomes refractory or unresponsive to further antigenic stimulation. These findings strongly suggest that the most efficient strategy for the induction of primary CD8(+) T cell responses is the delivery of a maximal amount of antigen in a single dose, thereby ensuring a clonal burst that involves the largest number of precursors to become memory cells"	['41108', '7407137', '3969636', '5516058', '347781', '31321820', '1328668']	[[{'name': 'Alder, N'}, {'name': 'Beveridge, NER'}, {'name': 'Davies, RJO'}, {'name': 'Gleeson, FV'}, {'name': 'Hill, AVS'}, {'name': 'McShane, H'}, {'name': 'Minassian, A'}, {'name': 'Pasvol, G'}, {'name': 'Pathan, AA'}, {'name': 'Poulton, I'}, {'name': 'Sander, CR'}, {'name': 'Van Wijgerden, J'}], [{'name': 'Adegbola, Richard A'}, {'name': 'Antonio, Martin'}, {'name': 'Briese, Thomas'}, {'name': 'Chimah, Osaretin'}, {'name': 'Corrah, Tumani'}, {'name': 'Dione, Michel'}, {'name': 'Ebruke, Bernard E'}, {'name': 'Greenwood, Brian'}, {'name': 'Hill, Philip C'}, {'name': 'Howie, Stephen RC'}, {'name': 'Ideh, Readon C'}, {'name': 'Jallow, Mariatou'}, {'name': 'Lipkin, W Ian'}, {'name': 'Machuka, Eunice M'}, {'name': 'Morris, Gerard AJ'}, {'name': 'Mulholland, Kim'}, {'name': 'Njie, Malick'}, {'name': 'Oluwalana, Claire'}, {'name': 'Secka, Ousman'}, {'name': 'Tokarz, Rafal'}, {'name': 'Townend, John'}], [{'name': 'Cose, Stephen'}, {'name': 'Dunne, David W'}, {'name': 'Elliott, Alison M'}, {'name': 'Jones, Frances M'}, {'name': 'Kihembo, Macklyn'}, {'name': 'Mawa, Patrice A'}, {'name': 'Tweyongyere, Robert'}, {'name': 'Vennervald, Birgitte J'}, {'name': 'Webb, Emily L'}], [{'name': 'Corrah, Tumani'}, {'name': 'Greenwood, Brian M'}, {'name': 'Howie, Stephen'}, {'name': 'Jaffar, Shabbar'}, {'name': 'Jasseh, Momodou'}, {'name': 'Smith, Peter G'}, {'name': 'Townend, John'}, {'name': 'Webb, Emily L'}], [{'name': 'Ansar A.

Internet and Digital Marketing have become important factors in campaigns, which attract and retain Internet users. This study aims to identify the main ways in which users can be gained and retained by using Digital Marketing. The Delphi method with in-depth interviews was the methodology used in this study. The results of the research show the most important actions for achieving user recruitment and loyalty with Digital Marketing from the opinions of consulted experts. The limitations of this study are those related to the number of experts included in the study, and the number of research papers consulted in the literature review. The literature review and the results of this research are used to propose new solid research with a consolidated critical methodology. This research deals with a new approach that will optimize web technologies for the evolution of user trends, and therefore, will be of academic and professional use for marketing managers and web solution developers. The conclusions of the investigation show the key factors, discarding others that do not affect the optimization of conversions in B2C businesses such as the duration of the session and the rebound percentage. Likewise, the results of the research identify the specific actions that must be carried out to attract and retain users in B2C companies that use the Digital Marketing ecosystem on the Internet. The requirements for companies that wish to implement a model to optimize conversions using the current digital economy are also shown.info:eu-repo/semantics/publishedVersio This is a revision of the concept of digital storytelling to get a definition from a point of view of consumer educommunication.

with their customers around the world. The increase in the use of social networks and how users
communicate with companies on the Internet has given rise to new business models based on the
bidirectionality of communication between companies and Internet users. Digital marketing, new
business models, online advertising campaigns, and other digital strategies have gathered user
opinions and comments through this new online channel. In this way, companies have started to
see the digital ecosystem as not only their present, but also as their future. From this long-term
perspective, companies are concerned about sustainability and the growth of their business models.
There are new business models on the Internet that support social causes, new platforms aimed at
supporting social and sustainable projects, and digital advertising campaigns promoting sustainability.
The overarching aim of this Special Issue was to analyze the development of these new strategies as
well as their influence on the sustainability of digital marketing strategies. Therefore, we aimed to
analyze how companies adopt these new technologies in a digital environment that is increasingly
concerned with the sustainability of business models and actions on the Internet The people who receive the information and buy products/services migrate, nowadays, from traditional to on-line media, a greater number of them is accessing the desired news from specialized sites and from mobile devices, anywhere and anytime.

e7818d09-5379-4c97-adda-43ed55435a98	academic performance	"Identifying the factors that influence academic performance is an essential
part of educational research. Previous studies have documented the importance
of personality traits, class attendance, and social network structure. Because
most of these analyses were based on a single behavioral aspect and/or small
sample sizes, there is currently no quantification of the interplay of these
factors. Here, we study the academic performance among a cohort of 538
undergraduate students forming a single, densely connected social network. Our
work is based on data collected using smartphones, which the students used as
their primary phones for two years. The availability of multi-channel data from
a single population allows us to directly compare the explanatory power of
individual and social characteristics. We find that the most informative
indicators of performance are based on social ties and that network indicators
result in better model performance than individual characteristics (including
both personality and class attendance). We confirm earlier findings that class
attendance is the most important predictor among individual characteristics.
Finally, our results suggest the presence of strong homophily and/or peer
effects among university students Predicting academic performance is of key importance to the success, wellbeing and
prosperity of students, their families, the economy, and the society at large. This study
investigates the relationship between academic engagement, psychological capital (PsyCap) and
academic performance. Data were collected in two different universities, one in Spain and
another in Portugal. Students completed two self-report questionnaires regarding academic
engagement and Psychological Capital. Academic performance was assessed through Grade
Point Average, provided by the universities at the end of the exam period. The samples consisted
of 389 and 243 undergraduate students, respectively. Results showed a positive relationship
between academic engagement and PsyCap, on the one hand, and academic performance on the
other, in both samples. Results also supported PsyCap as a full mediator in the relationship
between academic engagement and academic performance. Exploration of alternative models
yielded superior fit for the proposed model. Accordingly, academically engaged students were
likely to experience higher levels of PsyCap, which in turn positively impacted their academic
performance. The results point to the importance of considering psychological predictors, rather
than the prevalent reliance on traditional predictors of academic performance This paper discussed advantages and disadvantages associated with the use of ""admission tests"" as predictors of performance in undergraduate studies programs. The paper analyzes performance of economics and business administration students. This performance is linked to admission tests results. The paper also analyzes aspects of performance related to (i) differential progress through time, and (ii) differences in the extent to which students have ""areas of interest/ability"". The paper concludes that admission tests are a usefull tool even when predictions derived from them are far from perfect. This paper presents new evidence on the effects of class attendance on academic performance. We analyse survey data collected for an Introductory Econometrics Course at the Facultad de Ciencias Sociales y Jurídicas of Universidad Carlos III de Madrid, matched to administrative data. Using OLS-proxy regressions to control for unobservable student characteristics potentially correlated with attendance, we find a positive and significant effect of attendance on academic performance. However, the fact that instrumental variable regressions may be failing to account for the correlation not captured by the controls calls for further investigation based on panel data Academic performance, which measures a student’s success in learning, is influenced by various factors. One of the most important determinants of academic performance is social support. Parents, teachers, and friends all play a critical role in providing the necessary support that affects students’ cognitive engagement. Therefore, this study aimed to determine the relationship between social support and academic performance, which could be directly or indirectly mediated by cognitive engagement. The subjects used were 228 high school students in 11th grade, aged 15-18. Data were measured using Academic Performance Rating Scale (APRS), Child and Adolescent Social Support Scale (CASS), and Students Engagement Scale (SES) with Cronbach’s alpha values of 0.84, 0.93, and 0.88, respectively. The mediation analysis was conducted using the PROCESS model 4 developed by Hayes. The results showed that the relationship between social support and academic performance occurred through the mediation of cognitive engagement (� = 0.16), with no direct correlation (� = 0.12, p = 0.350). Specifically, more excellent social support was associated with increased cognitive engagement (� = 0.50, p = 0.000), leading to improved academic performance (� = 0.32, p = 0.005). Therefore, it was confirmed that social support is essential to students’ cognitive engagement and academic performance Gwen Bass provides a brief overview of the article, Do School Bullying and Student-Teacher Relationships Matter for Academic Achievement? Multilevel Analysis, originally published in the Canadian Journal of School Psychology. Through brief overviews of the introduction, methods, results, and limitations, the author outlines key takeaways from the article that can aid in school officials\u27 understanding of the relationship between school connectedness and academic outcomes This paper discussed advantages and disadvantages associated with the use of admission tests as predictors of performance in undergraduate studies programs. The paper analyzes performance of economics and business administration students. This performance is linked to admission tests results. The paper also analyzes aspects of performance related to (i) differential progress through time, and (ii) differences in the extent to which students have areas of interest/ability. The paper concludes that admission tests are a usefull tool even when predictions derived from them are far from perfect At the beginning of academic year 2007-08, staff in the Department of Physics
& Astronomy at the University of Glasgow started to implement a number of
substantial changes to the administration of the level 1 physics undergraduate
class. The main aims were to improve the academic performance and progression
statistics. With this in mind, a comprehensive system of learning support was
introduced, the main remit being the provision of an improved personal contact
and academic monitoring and support strategy for all students at level 1. The
effects of low engagement with compulsory continuous assessment components had
already been observed to have a significant effect for students sitting in the
middle of the grade curve. Analysis of data from the 2007-08 class showed that
even some nominally high-achieving students achieved lowered grades due to the
effects of low engagement. Nonetheless, academic and other support measures put
in place during 2007-08 played a part in raising the passrate for the level 1
physics class by approximately 8% as well as raising the progression rate by
approximately 10%.Comment: 12 pages, 3 figure Original article can be found at : http://www.sciencedirect.com/ Copyright ElsevierThe aim of study is to investigate the factors affecting the academic performance of international students in Project Management courses. To achieve this aim, a conceptual framework including three categories of factors: (i) Teaching Style, (ii) English Language and Communication and (iii) Assessment Methods was developed and empirically tested on a sample of international students from a British Post 92 University. The results suggest that the factors: level of details given in lectures, speed of lectures, academic internet sources, English Language skills, group or individual assessment, the qualitative/quantitative content of assessment are important drivers of the academic performance of international students in Project ManagementPeer reviewe Adolescents’ academic performance and the way it is related to their subjective wellbeing are issues of great interest across educational systems. The purpose of this study was to ascertain how satisfaction with high school subjects can predict school satisfaction and academic performance in Mexican students. The sample consisted of 457 high school students in the Baja California and Nuevo León states in Mexico (247 boys, 210 girls); their mean age being 14.10 (SD = 0.84). We used a questionnaire featuring a subject satisfaction scale, an intrinsic school satisfaction scale, and one related to academic grades. We used descriptive analyses, correlations, and structural regression models. In terms of results, the high satisfaction and academic performance levels in physical education, Spanish and English are worth highlighting. Geography and history are the most relevant predictors of academic grades, while Spanish predicts school satisfaction and physical education predicts boredom. In conclusion, satisfaction with mathematics, Spanish, and English are strong predictors of satisfaction (SATF), and the latter in turn predicts Mexican high school students’ academic performance This research examines if college GPA affects productivity and compensation in the workplace. It uses data collected from a survey of approximately 23,000 Bryant University graduates in different stages of their career. About 10 percent of the alumni surveyed completed the survey. The econometric model used in this study allows estimating the effect of GPA on income after controlling for various demographic and socioeconomic variables, including education, major, occupation, gender, among others. The empirical work provides evidence that GPA has a positive and statistically significant impact on workplace productivity for females, but GPA seems to be a weaker predictor of workplace productivity for males. In addition, there is strong evidence of a significant gender wage gap, but no evidence of a race wage gap Despite the large amount of attention that has been paid recently to understanding the determinants of educational outcomes, knowledge of the causal effect of the most fundamental input in the education production function - students' study time and effort - has remained virtually non-existent. In this paper, we examine the causal effect of studying on grade performance using an Instrumental Variable estimator. Our approach takes advantage of a unique natural experiment and is possible because we have collected unique longitudinal data that provides detailed information about all aspects of this experiment. Important for understanding the potential impact of a wide array of education policies, the results suggest that human capital accumulation is far from predetermined at the time of college entrance."

However, despite these characterisations throughout the centuries, there has been a very limited attempt to provide a rigorous and scholarly account of the totalitarian characteristics of the corporation. Although many would not agree with John McMurtry's assessment that the corporate sphere is a form of totalitarianism, in that we constantly encounter and experience powerful corporate representations of the world (e.g. advertising, marketing, branding) that reinforce and naturalise the corporation's very existence and our subservient place in relation to it (e.g. consumers, insecure employees, emasculated citizens), it is a question worth considering This Policy Brief examines how Europeâ??s corporations are changing the way they do business since the 2004 EU Enlargement. Dalia Marin argues that firms are adapting to heightening global competition by shifting decision-making processes. The author gives policy recommendations in the areas of EU neighbourhood and trade policies. An analysis of the lessons learned from the 1930s financial rescue mechanism, the Reconstruction Finance Corporation, and a comparison of its structure to that of today's Resolution Trust Corporation.Reconstruction Finance Corporation ; Resolution Trust Corporation (U.S.) Balotti and Shaner discuss the duties of and potential for imposing liability on corporate officers. The fiduciary duties of officers is addressed, in differing degrees, under Delaware law, the law frequently applied to corporate-governance disputes, and under the Model Business Corporation Act (MBCA). In discharging their fiduciary duties, directors under both the MBCA and the General Corporation Law are generally protected from personal liability if, in making business decisions, they reasonably rely on the reports and records of officers, employees, advisors, and experts of the corporation Formerly in New York State, businesses could operate as one of six different types: a business corporation, not-for-profit corporation, limited liability company, general partnership, limited partnership, or sole proprietorship. If Governor Cuomo signs the bill, businesses will be given a seventh option – the benefit corporation. A business corporation can incorporate under New York State law by filing a Certificate of Incorporation under Section 402 of the Business Corporation Law. Businesses must pay a filing fee of $125 as well as the additional tax on shares. Corporations may amend their Certificate of Incorporation under Section 805 of the Business Corporation Law by filing a Certificate of Amendment and paying a $60 filing fee. The Certificate of Amendment can amend any of the information found in the Certificate of Incorporation including name change and revision of the purpose clause	['4201038', '2765281', '34154631', '2456245', '34143737', '45007881']	[[{'name': 'Birch, Kean'}], [{'name': 'Dalia Marin'}], [{'name': 'O\\u27Neal, F.

En el presente trabajo se realizó la calificación termohidráulica de un intercambiador de calor de carcasa y tubos, con el fin de realizar la condensación de una corriente de metanol utilizando agua como refrigerante. El coeficiente de transferencia de calor global para las zonas de calor sensible y calor latente tuvo valores de 166,41 W/m2.K y 1.198,39 W/m2.K , respectivamente; mientras que el área total de transferencia de calor requerida y el porcentaje de área en exceso tuvieron valores de 38,08 m2 y 3,05 %, respectivamente. Las caídas de presión de las corrientes de metanol y agua alcanzaron los valores de 51.490,84 Pa y 2.890,50 Pa, respectivamente. El intercambiador de calor de carcasa y tubo propuesto se puede emplear satisfactoriamente para el servicio de transferencia de calor demandado, ya que el exceso de área porcentual calculado no supera el 25% y la caída de presión de la corriente de agua no supera el valor de 80.000 Pa La fiebre fue definida por Galeno, en líneas generales, como un incremento
de calor corporal. Pero esta simple definición entraña una grave dificultad
de comprensión ya que una de las notas características de la fisiología
galénica era que el organismo viviente, por el sólo hecho de serlo, poseía un
grado y cantidad determinados de calor dispuesto en su interior. Este calor
natural e innato podía sufrir aumentos y decrecimientos esporádicos, que no
eran considerados patológicos pues pertenecían al desenvolvimiento normal
del funcionalismo orgánico. Por contra, podía darse un incremento patológico
de calor, percibido por el médico en los mismos lugares que, por su
naturaleza, por poseer una naturaleza viva, estaban calientes, es decir, que
recibían el calor innato. Quizá resulte sorprendente que exista todo un
ciimulo de investigaciones dirigidas a encontrar si el asiento del calor patológico
era el calor innato o algún otro material, circulante por los mismos
recorridos que aquél. Incluso, los autores galenistas defendieron contundentemente
una de las dos hipótesis (1) Los tubos de calor son dispositivos que se caracterizan por tener una gran conductancia térmica, lo que los hace muy efectivos para el transporte de calor a grandes distancias con una muy pequeña caída de temperatura. Tienen una excepcional flexibilidad, son de construcción simple, de fácil control, y son de funcionamiento pasivo, no necesitan de potencia externa. La base teórica del funcionamiento de los tubos de calor tiene sus fundamentos en varias disciplinas clásicas como son: la mecánica de fluidos, transferencia de calor y termodinámica. El concepto de tubo de calor data desde 1944. Sin embargo, sus primeros desarrollos se iniciaron sólo el año 1964; impulsados principalmente por requerimientos de los programas espaciales que en esa época se llevaban a cabo. Precisamente, una de las primeras aplicaciones de los tubos de calor fue en satélites, donde se utilizaron como dispositivos para uniformar la distribución de temperaturas en su estructura, es decir, para transferir calor desde la zona expuesta al sol a la no expuesta, con el objeto de minimizar sus tensiones térmicas. Posteriormente, lentamente primero, se empezaron a desarrollar aplicaciones terrestres. En la actualidad, dados las amplias áreas de aplicación que se han descubierto, prácticamente todos los países desarrollados están involucrados en la investigación, desarrollo y comercialización de tubos de calor. Se vislumbra que este interés se mantendrá en el futuro; particularmente impulsado por la miniaturización de los sistemas en el campo de la electrónica, donde los problemas de disipación de calor no pueden ser resueltos utilizando sistemas convencionales Este estudio tuvo como objetivo evaluar el confort térmico para trabajadores, en tres edificaciones de procesamiento húmedo de café en Colombia, utilizando el índice WBGT, y análisis de temperatura y humedad relativa a través de mapeo. Los límites recomendados del WBGT fueron excedidos en la actividad de abastecimiento de combustible de la secadora en la Edificación 3. Las tres edificaciones presentaron variabilidad higrotérmica espacial debida a la secadora de café, y a problemas con la ventilación, volumen de control y resistencia térmica de materiales en los edificios 2 y 3. Para favorecer la transferencia de calor de la secadora al ambiente exterior, y hacer más homogéneo el ambiente térmico de las edificaciones, se recomienda instalar puentes térmicos alrededor de esta zona, y para hacer más eficiente la evacuación de vapor y calor, aumentar el área de ventilación natural en las edificaciones 2 y 3, e instalar claraboyas de ventilación sobre la secadora Este trabalho teve como objetivo estudar a variação do balanço de energia e analisar a partição do saldo de radiação em termos dos fluxos de calor latente e calor sensível, para a cultura de feijão caupi (Vigna unguiculata L.) Foram feitas medições contínuas dos fluxos de calor sensível, calor latente e saldo de radiação, no feijão caupi, cultivado na cidade de Tracuateua-PA, no período de agosto a setembro de 2002, usando-se a covariância dos vórtices turbulentos. O saldo de radiação representou, em média, 62% da radiação solar global. A maior porção do saldo de radiação foi usada como fluxo de calor sensível (61 %), enquanto o fluxo de calor latente respondeu apenas por 21 % do saldo de radiação. Esse baixo percentual do saldo de radiação usado como fluxo de calor latente ocorreu devido a restrições hídricas impostas pela falta de chuvas durante o período experimental O presente estudo teve como objetivo analisar a partição do saldo de radiação em seus componentes de calor latente e calor sensível na cultura do feijão caupi (Vigna unguiculata (L). Foram coletados, os dados das variáveis meteorológicas e dos fluxos de calor sensível e calores latentes na cidade de Tracuateua, estado do Pará, no período de agosto a setembro de 2002. Os dados de fluxos de calor latente e calor sensível foram obtidos pela técnica da covariância dos vórtices turbulentos (Eddy Correlation), processados pelo software EDISOL em médias horárias diurnas.

249ed809-a4ca-4229-bac6-459ccb26c447	vitamin d	"BACKGROUND Adults living in the sunny Australian climate are at high risk of skin cancer, but vitamin D deficiency (defined here as a serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D) concentration of less than 50 nmol/L) is also common. Vitamin D deficiency may be a risk factor for a range of diseases. However, the optimal strategies to achieve and maintain vitamin D adequacy (sun exposure, vitamin D supplementation or both), and whether sun exposure itself has benefits over and above initiating synthesis of vitamin D, remain unclear. The Sun Exposure and Vitamin D Supplementation (SEDS) Study aims to compare the effectiveness of sun exposure and vitamin D supplementation for the management of vitamin D insufficiency, and to test whether these management strategies differentially affect markers of immune and cardio-metabolic function. METHODS/DESIGN The SEDS Study is a multi-centre, randomised controlled trial of two different daily doses of vitamin D supplementation, and placebo, in conjunction with guidance on two different patterns of sun exposure. Participants recruited from across Australia are aged 18-64 years and have a recent vitamin D test result showing a serum 25(OH)D level of 40-60 nmol/L. DISCUSSION This paper discusses the rationale behind the study design, and considers the challenges but necessity of data collection within a non-institutionalised adult population, in order to address the study aims. We also discuss the challenges of participant recruitment and retention, ongoing engagement of referring medical practitioners and address issues of compliance and participant retention. TRIAL REGISTRATION Australia New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry: ACTRN12613000290796 Registered 14 March 2013 In this study, we aimed to assess levels of serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D in relation to metabolic syndrome among postmenopausal women in Gorgan. The study group included 100 postmenopausal women who were referred to the different Health Centers in Gorgan. Body mass index, waist circumference, Hip, waist to hip ratio, diastolic blood pressure, triglyceride, fasting blood glucose and 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels were significantly higher in postmenopausal women with metabolic syndrome, but HDL-cholesterol was lower. Prevalence of the metabolic syndrome was 31%. There were significant differences in 25-hydroxy vitamin D of postmenopausal women with and without vitamin D deficiency. Prevalence of the vitamin D deficiency in postmenopausal women was 30%. There were significant differences in 25-hydroxy vitamin D of postmenopausal women with and without vitamin D deficiency who had metabolic syndrome. Our results show that postmenopausal status might be a predictor of metabolic syndrome in this area. Our findings suggested that vitamin D levels have no association with metabolic syndrome. There were no significant differences in vitamin D levels in postmenopausal women with and without metabolic syndrome. Vitamin D deficiency is not associated with the metabolic syndrome The spectrum of activity of vitamin D goes beyond calcium and bone homeostasis, and growing evidence suggests that vitamin

D contributes to maintain musculoskeletal health in healthy subjects as well as in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD),

who display the combination of bone metabolism disorder, muscle wasting, and weakness. Here, we review how vitamin D

represents a pathway in which bone and muscle may interact. In vitro studies have confirmed that the vitamin D receptor

is present on muscle, describing the mechanisms whereby vitamin D directly affects skeletal muscle. These include genomic

and non‐genomic (rapid) effects, regulating cellular differentiation and proliferation. Observational studies have shown that

circulating 25‐hydroxyvitamin D levels correlate with the clinical symptoms and muscle morphological changes observed in

CKD patients. Vitamin D deficiency has been linked to low bone formation rate and bone mineral density, with an increased

risk of skeletal fractures. The impact of low vitamin D status on skeletal muscle may also affect muscle metabolic pathways,

including its sensitivity to insulin. Although some interventional studies have shown that vitamin D may improve physical

performance and protect against the development of histological and radiological signs of hyperparathyroidism, evidence is

still insufficient to draw definitive conclusions textVitamin D deficiency has been linked with many health problems. Early research demonstrated the importance of vitamin D for bone health, but it may also play a larger role than first reported in muscle health and function. Specifically, low vitamin D may hinder athletic performance, as such evaluation of serum vitamin D levels in high volume training athletes has merit.  The purpose of this study was to evaluate serum levels of 25(OH)D in college athletes to determine how many had levels below the recommended values. Data from student-athletes who were attending a large university in the south included: serum vitamin D levels, demographics information, and injury reports. Mean serum vitamin D level for the group was 34.17 ng/mL ± 0.88. Average injury for the group was 1.3± 0.14. The mean value of serum vitamin D for Caucasian players was 38.3 ng/mL ± 1.33 with a range of 23-59 ng/mL. The mean value of serum vitamin D for African American players was 31.16 ng/mL ± 1.08 with a range of 16-52 ng/mL. African American players had significantly lower serum vitamin D levels (p32 ng/ml). Players with one or more musculoskeletal injury or fracture had significantly lower serum vitamin D levels (p<0.05) compared to players that had zero injuries. African American players had significantly lower serum vitamin D levels (p<0.01) compared to Caucasian players. It is important for athletes to monitor serum vitamin D levels and adhere to a supplementation protocol when levels are insufficient.Kinesiology and Health Educatio Background: Hodkin s lymphoma is one of the most frequent lymphoma in western world. Despite an overall good prognosis some patients suffer relapsing tumors which are difficult to cure. Over a long period Vitamin D has been shown to be a potential treatment for cancer. Vitamin D acts via the vitamin D receptor, a nuclear receptor, acting as an inducible transcription factor. We aimed to investigate the expression of vitamin D receptor as potential therapeutic target structure in Hodgkin s lymphoma as well as in non Hodgkin s lymphoma.

Methods: We used a panel of 193 formalin fixed tissues of lymphoma cases consisting of 55 cases of Hodgkin s lymphoma and 138 cases on several non Hodgkin s lymphoma entities.

Results: Vitamin D receptor is strongly expressed in Hodgkin s lymphoma, regardless of the subentity with an overall positivity of 80% of all Hodgkin lymphoma cases. In contrast, only about 17% of the analyzed non Hodgkin s lymphoma of B-cell origin showed positivity for vitamin D receptor. Predominant nuclear localization of vitamin D receptor in Hodgkin s lymphoma suggests activated status of the vitamin D receptor.

Conclusions: From this study, we conclude that vitamin D receptor plays a potentially important role in pathogenesis of Hodgkin s lymphoma but not in non Hodgkin s lymphoma. Further investigations of mutational status and functional studies may shed some light in functional relevance of vitamin D receptor signaling in Hodgkin s lymphoma Introduction: Vitamin D may affect multiple health outcomes. If so, an effect on mortality is to be expected. Using pooled data from randomized controlled trials, we performed individual patient data (IPD) and trial level meta-analyses to assess mortality among participants randomized to either vitamin D alone or vitamin D with calcium.



Subjects and Methods: Through a systematic literature search, we identified 24 randomized controlled trials reporting data on mortality in which vitamin D was given either alone or with calcium. From a total of 13 trials with more than 1000 participants each, eight trials were included in our IPD analysis. Using a stratified Cox regression model, we calculated risk of death during 3 yr of treatment in an intention-to-treat analysis. Also, we performed a trial level meta-analysis including data from all studies.



Results: The IPD analysis yielded data on 70,528 randomized participants (86.8% females) with a median age of 70 (interquartile range, 62–77) yr. Vitamin D with or without calcium reduced mortality by 7% [hazard ratio, 0.93; 95% confidence interval (CI), 0.88–0.99]. However, vitamin D alone did not affect mortality, but risk of death was reduced if vitamin D was given with calcium (hazard ratio, 0.91; 95% CI, 0.84–0.98). The number needed to treat with vitamin D plus calcium for 3 yr to prevent one death was 151. Trial level meta-analysis (24 trials with 88,097 participants) showed similar results, i.e. mortality was reduced with vitamin D plus calcium (odds ratio, 0.94; 95% CI, 0.88–0.99), but not with vitamin D alone (odds ratio, 0.98; 95% CI, 0.91–1.06).



Conclusion: Vitamin D with calcium reduces mortality in the elderly, whereas available data do not support an effect of vitamin D alone BACKGROUND:

Vitamin D displays immunomodulatory activities and has been proposed as a potential player in the pathogenesis of rheumatoid arthritis (RA). A negative association between serum 25(OH) vitamin D levels and RA activity was demonstrated but longitudinal studies investigating the role of vitamin D levels in predicting RA activity and response to treatment are lacking. Therefore, this study was designed to test the hypothesis of an association between serum 25(OH) vitamin D levels at RA diagnosis and disease activity evaluated by clinimetric, laboratory and ultrasound (US) parameters and to detect the prevalence of remission and response to treatment after 12 months follow-up.

METHODS:

This is a longitudinal, retrospective study on data obtained from thirty-seven patients with early RA treatment-naïve. Serum inflammatory markers, auto-antibodies and 25(OH) vitamin D levels were obtained at baseline. Hypovitaminosis D was diagnosed for 25(OH) vitamin D levels < 20 ng/ml. Tender joint count (TJCs), swollen joint count (SJCs), Visual Analog Scales (VAS), Disease Activity Score (DAS) 28 score were assessed at baseline and 12 months after diagnosis. Joints synovitis and power-Doppler were evaluated at baseline and 12 months later.

RESULTS:

At baseline mean 25(OH) vitamin D levels were 24.4 ± 11.9 ng/ml; 35% of study subjects had hypovitaminosis D which strongly associated with higher RA activity and lower prevalence of remission and response to treatment (all p-values < 0.001). The percentage of patients not presenting a reduction of the US synovitis score after 12 months from diagnosis was significantly higher among patients with hypovitaminosis D than in those with normal serum 25(OH) vitamin D at baseline.

CONCLUSIONS:

In patients with early RA and basal hypovitaminosis D after 12 months follow-up reduction of disease activity and percentage of remission and response to treatment were significantly lower than those observed in patients with normal vitamin D levels. These results provide further support to the immunomodulatory action of vitamin D in RA and suggest a role of basal vitamin D status in the prediction of disease evolution. Vitamin D measurement and possibly vitamin D supplementation should be considered an additional option in the management of early RA patients In recent years, vitamin D has been received increased attention due to the resurgence of vitamin D deficiency and rickets in developed countries and the identification of extraskeletal effects of vitamin D, suggesting unexpected benefits of vitamin D in health and disease, beyond bone health. The possibility of extraskeletal effects of vitamin D was first noted with the discovery of the vitamin D receptor (VDR) in tissues and cells that are not involved in maintaining mineral homeostasis and bone health, including skin, placenta, pancreas, breast, prostate and colon cancer cells, and activated T cells. However, the biological significance of the expression of the VDR in different tissues is not fully understood, and the role of vitamin D in extraskeletal health has been a matter of debate.

and indicators forming academic procrastination construct. Academic procrastination is measured with two dimensions, namely the prevalence of 

procrastination and reason for procrastination. The subjects of this research were 60 11th grade high school students in Sukoharjo. The research applied 

the academic procrastination scale as data collection method. The data were analyzed with Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) SmartPLS 3.2.8 using 

reflective construct by CFA 2nd Order. Based on the analysis, the dimensions and the indicators forming academic procrastination construct are valid and 

reliable. The dimension dominantly reflecting the academic procrastination construct is the reason for procrastination with 0.816 loading factor. The 

dimension least reflecting the academic procrastination construct is the prevalence of procrastination with 0.776 loading factor. The results show that 

every dimension and indicator can reflect and form the academic procrastination construct. Therefore, the measurement model can be accepted for the 

theory illustrating academic procrastination is in accordance with the empirical data obtained from the subjects A model of time-consistent procrastination is developed to assess the extent to which the observed behavior is compatible with rational behavior. When a finite work requirement must be completed by a deadline, the remaining time for leisure is an exhaustible resource. With a positive rate of time preference, the optimal allocation of this resource results in more hours spent working (and fewer in leisure) the closer the deadline. Key qualitative findings of psychological studies of academic procrastination are consistent with the standard natural resource management principles implied by the model, when suitably adapted to task aversiveness, uncertainty, and multiple deadlines. However, quantitatively, the fully rational model requires an extremely high rate of time preference or elasticity of intertemporal substitution to generate serious procrastination; furthermore, it cannot explain undesired procrastination. A companion paper, ""Read This Paper Even Later: Procrastination with Time-Inconsistent Preferences"" analyzes the extent to which alternative time discounting preferences can better explain such impatience and address the issue of self-control failures. This dissertation presents a literature review on procrastination and more specifically research involving the domain of academic procrastination, characteristics/traits academic procrastinators exhibit, and two different types of academic procrastinators. Even though a comprehensive theory has not been established, social cognitive theory, attribution theory, and motivation theories contribute to our understanding of academic procrastination. Studies that investigate prevalence of high school and college students who procrastinate in international settings, and more specifically in the United States, are reviewed, along with the literature on the relationship between academic procrastination and achievement. Research has demonstrated with relative consistency that academic procrastination has significant adverse effects on academic progress (Ferrari et al., 2005; Moon & Illingworth, 2005) and that high percentages of undergraduate college students self-report they engage in academic procrastination (Steel, 2007).
The literature review is followed by an investigation that utilizes an adapted version of the Procrastination Assessment Scale-Students (Özer & Ferrari, 2011), a self-report instrument, to measure students’ academic procrastination. The purpose of this study was to investigate (a) the percentage of undergraduate college and high school students who self-report academic procrastination; (b) the frequency of academic procrastination among undergraduate college and high school students for the specific academic tasks of studying for exams, completing reading assignments, and writing papers; and (c) the relationship between academic procrastination and achievement of undergraduate college and high school students. Both on specific tasks and overall, significantly more college students report higher procrastination than high school students. Unexpectedly, this study did not find a significant relationship between academic procrastination and academic achievement, as measured by grade point average. This study highlights the importance of considering students’ age when examining academic procrastination Procrastination is a complex behavior with often negative consequences. Prior studies have found a positive correlation between procrastination and various negative emotional states, such as fear of failure. Conversely, specific mindfulness techniques, have been negatively associated with procrastination in prior research. The current study set out to examine the correlations of fear of failure and procrastination as well as those of mindfulness and procrastination. A sample of university students (n=310) were assessed using three scales: the Performance Failure Appraisal Inventory (PFAI), the Kentucky Inventory of Mindfulness Skills (KIMS), and the Pure Procrastination Scale (PPS). Results indicated a significant positive correlation between total fear of failure and total procrastination; total fear of failure and decisional procrastination; total fear of failure and timeliness/lateness; fear of important others losing interest and total procrastination; fear of important others losing interest and timeliness/lateness; fear of having an uncertain future and timeliness/lateness; and fear of experiencing shame or embarrassment and total procrastination. Findings indicated a significant negative correlation between acting with awareness and total procrastination; acting with awareness and delay in implementation; and describing and decisional procrastination. These findings support the view that, overall, fear of failure and procrastination are positively correlated and mindfulness and procrastination are inversely correlated. They point to further research being needed relative to whether mindfulness can play an intermediary role between the experience of fear of failure and procrastinatory behavior Introducción. La procrastinación es la acción de retrasar la realización de tareas necesarias, hasta el extremo de generar malestar y perjuicios a los individuos que la protagonizan. La presencia de alumnado no tradicional en las universidades se ha incrementado notablemente en las últimas décadas. Este tipo de estudiantes encuentra dificultades en sus estudios, las cua- les podrían propiciar una mayor incidencia de las conductas procrastinadoras. Para compro- barlo, comparamos los niveles de procrastinación y motivos para procrastinar entre estudian- tes tradicionales y no tradicionales.

Método. Utilizamos una muestra de 479 estudiantes colombianos. Los niveles de procrasti- nación y motivos para procrastinar fueron medidos a partir de la Procrastination Assessment Scale – Students (PASS). En el análisis de datos se utilizaron estadísticos descriptivos, análisis factorial exploratorio, prueba t para muestras independientes y d de Cohen.

Resultados. Los estudiantes no tradicionales han presentado niveles de procrastinación supe- riores (t=4,412; p<0,001; d=0,459), aunque los motivos para procrastinar no difieren de los aportados por estudiantes tradicionales. El carácter de estudiante no tradicional ha resultado ser una variable relevante en la explicación de la procrastinación académica.

Discusión y conclusiones. A partir de estos resultados, se deriva la conveniencia de ofrecer una orientación académica al alumnado no tradicional, con el fin de tratar la procrastinación y reducir así posibles riesgos de bajo rendimiento o abandono en este colectivo estudiantil.Introduction. Procrastination is the act of delaying necessary tasks until the extreme of ex- periencing discomfort and negative consequences to the individuals. The presence of nontra- ditional students at universities is a phenomenon which has increased remarkably over the last decades. This type of university students finds some difficulties during their grade. This could result in a higher prevalence of procrastination behaviors among nontraditional students at university. To test this, our work compares procrastination levels and reasons to procrastinate among traditional and nontraditional students
Method. A sample of 479 Colombian college students was used. Procrastination and the rea- sons to procrastinate are measured by the Procrastination Assessment Scale - Students (PASS). The data analysis is based on descriptive statistics, exploratory factorial analysis, t test for independent samples and Coohen’s d.
Results. Nontraditional students show higher procrastination levels (t=4,412; p<0,001; d=0,459), although their reasons to procrastinate are similar to those of traditional students. The nontraditional student condition is a demographic variable relevant for explaining aca- demic procrastination.
Discussion and Conclusion. These results suggest the convenience of offering academic counselling and guidance to nontraditional students, in order to attend procrastination and reducing that way low achievement or dropout risks"	['87525231', '4230015', '71854808', '150550036', '46723249']	[[{'name': 'Lenggono, Budi'}, {'name': 'Tentama, Fatwa'}], [{'name': 'Fischer, Carolyn'}], [{'name': 'Janssen, Jill'}], [{'name': 'Parlade, Jose M'}], [{'name': 'Garzón Umerenkova, Angélica'}, {'name': 'Gil Flores, Javier'}]]	['Construction measurement of academic procrastination of eleventh grade high school students in Sukoharjo', 'Read This Paper Later: Procrastination with Time-Consistent Preferences', 'Academic Procrastination: Prevalence Among High School and Undergraduate Students and Relationship to Academic Achievement', 'Fear of Failure, Mindfulness, and Procrastination', 'Academic procrastination in non-traditional college students']	5.0	exploratory	0.5

from the free flow regime to the jammed regime. We introduce a method of
analyzing the data which is based on the local density distribution. This
analyzes allows us to determine the phase diagram and to examine the separation
of the system into a coexisting free flow phase and a jammed phase above the
transition. The investigation of the steady state structure factor yields that
the decomposition in this phase coexistence regime is driven by density
fluctuations, provided they exceed a critical wavelength.Comment: in 'Traffic and Granular Flow 97', edited by D.E. Wolf and M.
  Schreckenberg, Springer, Singapore (1998 A new single lane car following model of traffic flow is presented. The model
is inertial and free of collisions. It demonstrates experimentally observed
features of traffic flow such as the existence of three regimes: free,
fluctuative (synchronized) and congested (jammed) flow; bistability of free and
fluctuative states in a certain range of densities, which causes the hysteresis
in transitions between these states; jumps in the density-flux plane in the
fluctuative regime and gradual spatial transition from synchronized to free
flow. Our model suggests that in the fluctuative regime there exist many stable
states with different wavelengths, and that the velocity fluctuations in the
congested flow regime decay approximately according to a power law in time.Comment: 4 pages, 4 figure We perform direct numerical simulations of wall sheared Rayleigh-B\'enard
(RB) convection for Rayleigh numbers up to $Ra=10^8$, Prandtl number unity, and
wall shear Reynolds numbers up to $Re_w=10000$. Using the Monin-Obukhov length
$L_{MO}$ we identify three different flow states, a buoyancy dominated regime
($L_{MO} \lesssim \lambda_{\theta}$; with $\lambda_{\theta}$ the thermal
boundary layer thickness), a transitional regime ($0.5H \gtrsim L_{MO} \gtrsim
\lambda_{\theta}$; with $H$ the height of the domain), and a shear dominated
regime ($L_{MO} \gtrsim 0.5H$). In the buoyancy dominated regime the flow
dynamics are similar to that of turbulent thermal convection. The transitional
regime is characterized by rolls that are increasingly elongated with
increasing shear. The flow in the shear dominated regime consists of very
large-scale meandering rolls, similar to the ones found in conventional Couette
flow. As a consequence of these different flow regimes, for fixed $Ra$ and with
increasing shear, the heat transfer first decreases, due to the breakup of the
thermal rolls, and then increases at the beginning of the shear dominated
regime. For $L_{MO} \gtrsim 0.5H$ the Nusselt number $Nu$ effectively scales as
$Nu \sim Ra^{\alpha}$, with $\alpha \ll 1/3$ while we find $\alpha \simeq 0.31$
in the buoyancy dominated regime. In the transitional regime the effective
scaling exponent is $\alpha > 1/3$, but the temperature and velocity profiles
in this regime are not logarithmic yet, thus indicating transient dynamics and
not the ultimate regime of thermal convection A swirler for a gas turbine engine combustor is disclosed for simultaneously controlling combustor flow rate, swirl angle, residence time and fuel-air ratio to provide three regimes of operation. A first regime is provided in which fuel-air ratio is less than stoichiometric, NOx is produced at one level, and combustor flow rate is high. In a second regime, fuel-air ratio is nearly stoichiometric, NOx production is less than that of the first regime, and combustor flow rate is low. In a third regime, used for example at highoff, fuel-air ratio is greater than stoichiometric and the combustor flow rate is less than in either of the other regimes We have conducted double-shear biaxial deformation experiments in layers of NaCl within its fully-plastic (FP) regime up to large shear strains (γ < 50) with velocity steps. From this, we have empirically formulated a rate- and state-dependent flow law which explains the transient mechanical behavior. The steady state flow stress in the FP regime can be explained by a power-law with a stress exponent ~8.5 and an activation enthalpy of ~1.3 eV, with the instantaneous response having a higher stress exponent (13 ± 8), although there is data scatter. The transition to brittle regime is associated with weakening from the ductile flow law. In FP regime, the mechanical response is characterized by a monotonic decay to a new steady state while in the transitional regime, by a peak-decay behavior. The transient flow law obtained here is of considerable importance in the study of the brittle-ductile transition in rocks"	['933432', '875785', '59108754', '4475074', '2258066']	[[{'name': 'Lubeck, S.'}, {'name': 'Schreckenberg, M.'}, {'name': 'Usadel, K.

6d63a4b2-8ae3-43b1-8a43-b1de20e5f71e	intergroup	From an intergroup relations perspective, relative group size is associated with the quantity and quality of intergroup contact: more positive contact (i.e., intergroup friendship) supports, and negative contact (i.e., experienced discrimination) hampers, minority identity, and school success. Accordingly, we examined intergroup contact as the process through which perceived relative proportions of minority and majority students in school affected minority success (i.e., school performance, satisfaction, and self-efficacy). Turkish minorities (N = 1,060) were compared in four Austrian and Belgian cities which differ in their typical school ethnic composition. Across cities, minority experiences of intergroup contact fully mediated the impact of perceived relative group size on school success. As expected, higher minority presence impaired school success through restricting intergroup friendship and increasing experienced discrimination. The association between minority presence and discrimination was curvilinear, however, so that schools where minority students predominated offered some protection from discrimination. To conclude, the comparative findings reveal positive and negative intergroup contact as key processes that jointly explain when and how higher proportions of minority students affect school success The present study focused on the buffering role of positive intergroup contact in the intergenerational transmission of authoritarianism and racial prejudice in a sample of adolescents and one of their parents. In accordance with our expectations, adolescents’ intergroup contact experiences moderated the mediated relationships between parental authoritarianism and adolescents’ prejudice, both via adolescents’ authoritarianism and via parental prejudice. These relationships were stronger among adolescents with lower, rather than higher, levels of intergroup contact. We conclude that intergroup contact buffers the indirect relationship between parents’ authoritarianism and adolescents’ racial prejudice and therefore constitutes a promising means of reducing the intergenerational transmission of prejudice Proof oSubjective intergroup beliefs and authoritarianism were assessed in a field study (N= 255) of White Australians’ anti-Asian stereotyping and prejudice. A social identity analysis of intergroup prejudice was adopted, such that perceptions of the intergroup structure (instability, permeability, legitimacy and higher ingroup status) were proposed as predictors of higher prejudice (blatant and covert) and less favorable stereotyping. Consistent with the social identity approach, both independent and interacting roles for sociostructural predictors of Anti-Asian bias were observed, even after demographic and personality variables were controlled. For example, perceived legitimacy was associated with higher prejudice when White Australians’ status position relative to Asian Australians was valued. Moreover, when participants evaluated Whites’ position as unstable and high status or legitimate, perceptions of permeable intergroup boundaries were associated with anti-Asian bias. The present findings demonstrate status protection responses in advantaged group members in a field setting, lending weight to the contention that perceptions of sociostructural threat interact to predict outgroup derogation. Implications for theories of intergroup relations are discussed Longitudinal effects of intergroup contact on prejudice were investigated in a sample of 65 young adults (Sample 1) and a sample of their close friends (Sample 2, N = 172), adopting a full cross-lagged panel design. We first validated the self-report measure of intergroup contact from sample 1 with observer ratings from sample 2 by demonstrating that self-reports and observer ratings of contact were highly correlated. Moreover, we obtained significant cross-lagged effects of intergroup contact on prejudice with both contact measures, thereby providing a second validation for the use of self-reports of intergroup contact. Finally, by the use of latent change modeling we demonstrated that, although no overall significant change in contact and prejudice over time was found, there was meaningful variation in absolute change in the individual levels of intergroup contact and prejudice. In particular, some individuals showed increases while others showed decreases in contact or prejudice across time. Moreover, higher levels of intergroup contact at Time 1 were followed by larger subsequent decreases in prejudice between Time 1 and Time 2, and changes in contact were significantly and negatively related to changes in prejudice. Methodological implications of the findings are discussed The present research tests the indirect effects of intergroup contact on adolescents’ bystander intervention intentions via four potential mediators: “empathy,” “cultural openness,” “in-group bias,” and “intergroup anxiety.” British adolescents (N = 855), aged 11–13 years, completed measures of intergroup (interethnic) contact and the identified indirect variables. Intended bystander behavior was measured by presenting participants with an intergroup (immigrant) name-calling scenario. Participants rated the extent to which they would behave assertively. The findings extend previous intergroup contact research by showing a significant indirect effect of intergroup contact on assertive bystander intentions via empathy, cultural openness and in-group bias (but not via intergroup anxiety). Theoretical implications and practical suggestions for future prejudice-reduction interventions are discussed	['8034622', '8221127', '4573240', '8220607', '8220942']	[[{'name': 'Agirdag'}, {'name': 'Alba'}, {'name': 'Allport'}, {'name': 'Aronson'}, {'name': 'Bail'}, {'name': 'Benner'}, {'name': 'Binder'}, {'name': 'Blalock'}, {'name': 'Blossfeld'}, {'name': 'Blumer'}, {'name': 'Branscombe'}, {'name': 'Brown'}, {'name': 'Cohen'}, {'name': 'Derks'}, {'name': 'Dixon'}, {'name': 'Durkin'}, {'name': 'Eccles'}, {'name': 'Eller'}, {'name': 'Fischer'}, {'name': 'Garcia Coll'}, {'name': 'Graham'}, {'name': 'Graham'}, {'name': 'Hanish'}, {'name': 'Hanushek'}, {'name': 'Heath'}, {'name': 'Herzog-Punzenberger'}, {'name': 'Hu'}, {'name': 'Janssens'}, {'name': 'Jenkins'}, {'name': 'Juvonen'}, {'name': 'Kline'}, {'name': 'Konan'}, {'name': 'Kristen'}, {'name': 'Laar'}, {'name': 'Levin'}, {'name': 'Longshore'}, {'name': 'Massey'}, {'name': 'Matsumoto'}, {'name': 'McGlothlin'}, {'name': 'Mendoza-Denton'}, {'name': 'Mendoza-Denton'}, {'name': 'Musterd'}, {'name': 'Muthén'}, {'name': 'Muthén'}, {'name': 'Nesdale'}, {'name': 'Pettigrew'}, {'name': 'Pettigrew'}, {'name': 'Pettigrew'}, {'name': 'Phinney'}, {'name': 'Phinney'}, {'name': 'Portes'}, {'name': 'Postmes'}, {'name': 'Purdie-Vaughns'}, {'name': 'Quillian'}, {'name': 'Rumberger'}, {'name': 'Saguy'}, {'name': 'Schofield'}, {'name': 'Schwarzer'}, {'name': 'Segregation in School'}, {'name': 'Shook'}, {'name': 'Stearns'}, {'name': 'Swart'}, {'name': 'Tezanos-Pinto'}, {'name': 'The Integration of European Second-Generation Survey Austria'}, {'name': 'The Integration of European Second-Generation Survey Belgium'}, {'name': 'Thernstrom'}, {'name': 'Tropp'}, {'name': 'Verkuyten'}, {'name': 'Wagner'}, {'name': 'Walton'}, {'name': 'Wong'}, {'name': 'Wright'}], [{'name': 'Aiken'}, {'name': 'Alain Van Hiel'}, {'name': 'Allport'}, {'name': 'Altemeyer'}, {'name': 'Branch'}, {'name': 'Carlson'}, {'name': 'Dhont'}, {'name': 'Dhont'}, {'name': 'Dhont'}, {'name': 'Dhont'}, {'name': 'Duriez'}, {'name': 'Duriez'}, {'name': 'Hodson'}, {'name': 'Hodson'}, {'name': 'Kristof Dhont'}, {'name': 'McConahay'}, {'name': 'Peterson'}, {'name': 'Pettigrew'}, {'name': 'Pratto'}, {'name': 'Preacher'}, {'name': 'Rodríguez-García'}, {'name': 'Roets'}, {'name': 'Sibley'}, {'name': 'van Dick'}], [{'name': 'Adorno, T.

1ec2ca85-dd53-48a2-a737-efa4e01b8d39	tumor markers	"The aim of this study was to investigate the diagnostic power of CA 549, MSA and CA 15-3 in identifying breast cancer. The study included 232 patients of which 56 were healthy, 43 had benign breast cancer and 191 with other growths. The results were obtained using a specific immunoassay and using producers' cut offs. The following sensitivity and specificity of markers were found: CA 549 (sen.: 40%/spec.: 90%), MSA (sen.: 22%/spec.: 96%), and CA 15-3 (sen.: 33%/spec.: 86%). Ideal cut offs were defined with ROC curves. A significant correlation was found between CA 549, MSA, and CA 15-3. The combination of markers does not improve the clinical usefulness to identify only breast cancer. Serum tumor markers are abnormally elevated in patients with breast cancer. CA 549, MSA, CA 15-3 are useful clinical markers, good indicators of disease extent, and may have important prognostic value. This study demonstrates the role of the tumor markers in breast cancer Recommendations are presented for the routine clinical use of serum and tissue-based markers in the diagnosis and management of patients with breast cancer. Their low sensitivity and specificity preclude the use of serum markers such as the MUC-1 mucin glycoproteins ( CA 15.3, BR 27.29) and carcinoembryonic antigen in the diagnosis of early breast cancer. However, serial measurement of these markers can result in the early detection of recurrent disease as well as indicate the efficacy of therapy. Of the tissue-based markers, measurement of estrogen and progesterone receptors is mandatory in the selection of patients for treatment with hormone therapy, while HER-2 is essential in selecting patients with advanced breast cancer for treatment with Herceptin ( trastuzumab). Urokinase plasminogen activator and plasminogen activator inhibitor 1 are recently validated prognostic markers for lymph node-negative breast cancer patients and thus may be of value in selecting node-negative patients that do not require adjuvant chemotherapy. Copyright (C) 2005 S. Karger AG, Basel BACKGROUND: Several parameters of the tumor microenvironment, such as hypoxia, inflammation and angiogenesis, play a critical role in tumor aggressiveness and treatment response. A major question remains if these markers can be used to stratify patients to certain treatment protocols. The purpose of this study was to investigate the inter-relationship and the prognostic significance of several biological and clinicopathological parameters in patients with head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) treated by radiotherapy ± chemotherapy. METHODS: We used two subgroups of a retrospective series for which CT-determined tumoral perfusion correlated with local control. In the first subgroup (n = 67), immunohistochemistry for carbonic anhydrase IX (CA IX) and glucose transporter-1 (GLUT-1) was performed on the pretreatment tumor biopsy. In the second subgroup (n = 34), enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) was used to determine pretreatment levels of the cytokines vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and interleukin-6 (IL-6) in serum. Correlation was investigated between tumoral perfusion and each of these biological markers, as well as between the markers mutually. The prognostic value of these microenvironmental parameters was also evaluated. RESULTS: For CA IX and GLUT-1, the combined assessment of patients with both markers expressed above the median showed an independent correlation with local control (p = 0.02) and disease-free survival (p = 0.04) with a trend for regional control (p = 0.06). In the second subgroup, IL-6 pretreatment serum level above the median was the only independent predictor of local control (p = 0.009), disease-free survival (p = 0.02) and overall survival (p = 0.005). CONCLUSION: To our knowledge, we are the first to report a link in HNSCC between IL-6 pretreatment serum levels and radioresistance in vivo. This link is supported by the strong prognostic association of pretreatment IL-6 with local control, known to be the most important parameter to judge radiotherapy responses. Furthermore, the combined assessment of CA IX and GLUT-1 correlated independently with prognosis. This is a valuable indication that a combined approach is important in the investigation of prognostic markers The target effects on the expression of epithelial-mesenchymal transition regulation molecules are promising for cancer therapy, including breast cancer. 3D cell culture is a model for studying epithelial-mesenchymal transition in vitro and may become a test system for anticancer therapy.Aim of research. The aim of this research was to evaluate and compare the expression of tumor associated and epithelial-mesenchymal transition markers in tumor cells of breast adenocarcinoma (MCF-7 cell line) in 2D and 3D cell culture.Methods. For realization of the aim MCF-7 cell line (breast adenocarcinoma) was chosen as an experimental model in vitro. The monolayer cell culture was cultured in standard conditions (37 0C, 5 % CO2, humidity 95 %). The initial density of inoculated cells was 2 x 104 cells/cm2. The cells were incubated for two days before their use in the experiment. For the initial generation of spheroids the monolayer cell culture was removed off the substrate after the four days of incubation, using 0,25 % Trypsin-EDTA, and placed in nutrient medium with 5 % carboxymethyl cellulose (Bio-Rad, USA) at concentration of 5 x 105 cells/ml. Then the plates were incubated on an orbital shaker (Orbital shaker, PSU-10i, Biosan, Latvia) at 50 rpm for 3–5 hours. Half of culture medium was replenished every 3 days. A spheroid culture was maintained for 14 days. Detection of markers (ER, p53, EpCAM, vim, AE1/AE3, panCK, EGFR) in 2D and 3D cell culture was performed using immunohistochemistry method with primary monoclonal antibodies. Histological samples of cells were photographed to compare the morphological characteristics and the expression of proteins in monolayer and spheroid cultureResults. The results demonstrated that the percentage of tumor marker positive cells (ER+, EGFR+, EpCAM+, panCK+, AE1/AE3+) in monolayer culture is 1.25–2 times than more in spheroid culture. In contrast, tumor spheroids consist of fewer cells with the expression of epithelial markers such as EpCAM and AE1/AE3, but they contain a large number of cells that expressed mesenchymal marker vimentin by 5 % and p53 by 10 %. This may indicate that the cells acquire a mesenchymal phenotype. However, tumor cells of monolayer cell culture were not expressed vimentin.Conclusions. Our results demonstrated the differences of expression of tumor associated and epithelial-mesenchymal transition markers in 2D and 3D breast cancer cell cultures. Thus, the percentage of epithelial markers (Cytokeratines and epithelial cell adhesion molecule) in tumor spheroids is less than in cells of monolayer however spheroids cells begin expressing a mesenchymal marker – vimentin. In 3D cell culture only the outer cell layers expressed tumor associated proteins unlike 2D cell culture in which all of cells showed equally expression. Reduced of manifestation of tumor associated markers in 3D cell culture may indicate an increase of stem properties. These data showed that 3D cell culture more than 2D cell culture characterized processes of epithelial-mesenchymal transition Checkpoint inhibitor-based immunotherapy is opening a promising scenario in oncology, with objective responses registered in multiple cancer types. However, reliable predictive markers of tumor responsiveness are still lacking. These markers need to be urgently identified for a better selection of patients that can be candidates for immunotherapy. In this pilot study, a cohort of 34 consecutive patients bearing programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1)-positive non-small cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC), treated with pembrolizumab, was considered. The retrospective immuno-phenotypic analysis performed on the original tumor biopsies allowed for the identification of a specific “galectin signature”, which strongly correlated with tumor responsiveness to anti PD-1 immunotherapy. We observed that the large majority of patients (about 90%) with high galectin-3 tumor expression (score 3+) showed an early and dramatic progression of the disease after three cycles of treatments. In contrast, all patients with negative or low/intermediate expression of galectin-3 in tumor cells showed an early and durable objective response to pembrolizumab, indicating galectin-3 as an interesting predictive marker of tumor responsiveness. The galectin-3 signature, at least in NSCLCs, promises a better selection of patient candidates for immunotherapy, reducing unnecessary treatment exposures and social costs. A large multicenter study is ongoing to validate this finding Increased glucose uptake mediated by glucose
transporters and reliance on glycolysis are common features
of malignant cells. Hypoxia-inducible factor-1α supports the
adaptation of hypoxic cells by inducing genes related to
glucose metabolism. The contribution of glucose transporter
(GLUT) and hypoxia-inducible factor-1α (HIF-1α) activity to
tumor behavior and their prognostic value in head and neck
cancers remains unclear. The aim of this study was to examine
the predictive value of GLUT1, GLUT3, and HIF-1α messenger
RNA (mRNA)/protein expression as markers of tumor
aggressiveness and prognosis in laryngeal cancer. The level of
hypoxia/metabolic marker genes was determined in 106 squamous
cell laryngeal cancer (SCC) and 73 noncancerous
matched mucosa (NCM) controls using quantitative realtime
PCR. The related protein levels were analyzed by
Western blot. Positive expression of SLC2A1, SLC2A3, and
HIF-1α genes was noted in 83.9, 82.1, and 71.7 % of SCC
specimens and in 34.4, 59.4, and 62.5 % of laryngeal cancer
samples. Higher levels of mRNA/protein for GLUT1 and
HIF-1α were noted in SCC compared to NCM (p<0.05).
SLC2A1 was found to have a positive relationship with grade,
tumor front grading (TFG) score, and depth and mode of
invasion (p<0.05). SLC2A3 was related to grade and invasion
type (p<0.05). There were also relationships of HIF-1α with
pTNM, TFG scale, invasion depth and mode, tumor recurrences,
and overall survival (p<0.05). In addition, more advanced
tumors were found to be more likely to demonstrate
positive expression of these proteins. In conclusion, the
hypoxia/metabolic markers studied could be used as molecular
markers of tumor invasiveness in laryngeal cancer.This work was supported, in part, by the statutory

043 32/2326) The Epithelial to Mesenchymal Transition (EMT) plays a role not

only in tumor metastasis but also in tumor recurrence. This process

is believed to be tightly linked to the presence of Cancer Stem Cells

(CSCs) however, it is still not clear which factors could induce EMT

and how it could be a source for CSCs. It has been demonstrated

that Malignant Pleural Effusion (MPEs) may represent an excellent

source to identify markers and molecular mechanisms involved in

EMT and CSCs development. Growth factors, cell differentiation

markers and molecular adhesion are involved in some of the crucial

neoplastic cell events such as proliferation, metastasis, resistance

to chemotherapy and EMT. In this review, we summarize the current

understanding of which molecular markers can orchestrate EMT and

CSCs in MPEs n this study we analyzed the expression levels of markers of epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) in several papillary thyroid carcinomas (PTCs) and the relation with tumor genotypes and clinicopathological characteristics. The role of fibronectin-1 (FN1) was investigated by analyzing the effects of FN1 silencing in two human thyroid cancer cell lines. Most of EMT markers were significantly over-expressed in a group of 36 PTCs. In particular, FN1 mRNA levels were higher in tumor vs non-tumor tissue (117.3, p < 0.001) and also in aggressive and BRAF(V600E) samples. Similar results were observed (and confirmed at the protein level) when FN1 expression was analyzed in a validation group of 50 PTCs and six lymph node (LN) metastases. Silencing of FN1 in TPC-1 and BCPAP thyroid cancer cells significantly reduced proliferation, adhesion, migration, and invasion in both cell lines.

These are apparently more prevalent in high-intensity endurance sports. The purpose of this study was to assess the association between ECG findings in athletes and intensity of sport and level of competition. METHODS: A cohort of 3423 competitive athletes had their ECGs assessed according to the Seattle criteria (SC). The presence of abnormal ECGs was correlated with: (1) intensity of sport (low/moderate vs. at least one high static or dynamic component); (2) competitive level (regional vs. national/international); (3) training volume (≤20 vs. >20 hours/week); (4) type of sport (high dynamic vs. high static component). The same endpoints were studied according to the 'Refined Criteria' (RC). RESULTS: Abnormal ECGs according to the SC were present in 225 (6.6%) athletes, more frequently in those involved in high-intensity sports (8.0% vs. 5.4%; p=0.002), particularly in dynamic sports, and competing at national/international level (7.1% vs. 4.9%; p=0.028). Training volume was not significantly associated with abnormal ECGs. By multivariate analysis, high-intensity sport (OR 1.55, 1.18-2.03; p=0.002) and national/international level (OR 1.50, 95% CI 1.04-2.14; p=0.027) were independent predictors of abnormal ECGs, and these variables, when combined, doubled the prevalence of this finding. According to the RC, abnormal ECGs decreased to 103 (3.0%), but were also more frequent in high-intensity sports (4.2% vs. 2.0%; p<0.001). CONCLUSIONS: There is a positive correlation between higher intensity of sports and increased prevalence of ECG abnormalities. This relationship persists with the use of more restrictive criteria for ECG interpretation, although the number of abnormal ECGs is lower O objetivo deste artigo é discutir a problemática da permanência e da evasão dos alunos atletas na Educação Superior.  De natureza quantitativa, o estudo apoia-se em dados oficiais coletados de uma determinada Instituição de Ensino de São Paulo na qual esses alunos estão matriculados, a partir da consulta do controle de matrículas e freqüência dos atletas bolsistas ingressantes em janeiro de 2012. A discussão dos dados coletados conta com o apoio dos teóricos da área de Política Pública em Educação Superior e de estudos realizados por outros pesquisadores relacionados às políticas de acesso, permanência, evasão escolar e escolarização dos atletas. Como resultado, espera-se contribuir com as ações, programas ou projetos que visam apoiar os atletas quanto ao acesso, a permanência e a conclusão de seus estudos na educação superior Emparelhar crianças propicia sucesso e reduz lesões no desporto. Apesar das diferenças de maturação entre
crianças, a idade cronológica mantém-se o principal critério para equalizar os níveis de competição, mas com
uma eficiência limitada. No entanto, no karaté, o peso também é considerado. Fomos verificar se existe associação entre a idade cronológica e os indicadores maturacionais e, encontrar modelos simples que permitam colocar em reflexão novas formas de avaliação da maturação. Foram recolhidos dados em 54 jovens
praticantes de karaté (idade: 12,67 ± 2,49 anos; experiência: 4,99 ± 2,44 anos; altura: 150,45 ± 15,25cm; peso: 43,09 ± 14,17 kg, 20 raparigas). A idade correlacionou-se significativamente com auto-observação da maturação sexual (rho = 0,838; p < 0,01), e foi possível encontrar modelos de regressão simples que têm uma
explicação moderada na maturação, apenas utilizando variáveis de medição simples, tal como a altura, o peso e o perímetro do braço. Estes resultados devem levar as entidades competentes a refletir acerca do modo de
emparelhamento dos atletas nas competições de uma forma justa em termos de maturação.Paring children improve the chance for success and reduce injury in sport. Despite the maturity differences between children, chronological age remains the main criterion to equalize competition levels, but with limited efficiency. However, in Karate, weight is also considered. We went to investigate the association between chronological age and maturational indicators and find simple models to put on reflection new ways to assess the maturity. Data were collected in 54 young Karate practitioners (age: 12.67 ± 2.49 years, experience: 4.99 ± 2.44 years, height: 150.45 ± 15.25 cm, weight: 43.09 ± 14, 17 kg, 20 girls). Age correlated significantly with self-observation of sexual maturation (rho = 0.838; p < 0.01), and it was possible to find simple regression models that have a moderate explanation in maturation, using only simple measurable variables such as the height, weight and arm circumference. These results should lead the competent entities to reflect on the way of pairing of the athletes in the competitions, in a fair way in terms of maturation.info:eu-repo/semantics/publishedVersio Este trabalho teve como objectivo avaliar a ingestão alimentar em atletas adolescentes, na modalidade de Hóquei em Patins, durante as fases de pré-competição, competição e pós-competição. Monitorizaram-se 20 atletas com idades entre os 13 e os 17 anos. As avaliações foram realizadas entre Fevereiro e Março de 2010. Foi usado um questionário estruturado, que teve como objectivo recolher informação acerca da ingestão alimentar durante o ciclo competitivo. Procedeu-se ainda à avaliação antropométrica dos atletas em questão (peso, estatura, composição corporal e perímetro da cintura). Os atletas apresentaram um índice de massa corporal médio de 21,6kg/m2±2,4 e uma percentagem de gordura corporal média de 14,6%±4,7. Destes atletas, 50% reportam fazer algum tipo de suplementação. Relativamente aos macronutrientes, 85% dos atletas consideram que os Glícidos são cruciais para este desporto. Quanto à hidratação, no período competitivo observou-se que 85% da amostra apenas ingere água quando o sintoma sede é desencadeado. No período pós-competição, 40% da amostra refere que dá importância à alimentação, contudo 70% não tem noção das recomendações existentes. Os atletas avaliados evidenciaram diversos erros alimentares e pouca capacidade de adequação da ingestão em função do ciclo competitivo Background and Study Aim: Despite recognised benefits of regular physical activity for health, the percentage of individuals linking with a physical activity practice sufficient to confer health benefits is low. The aim of current work is knowledge about effects of an extension of the motivation trans-contextual model application, specifically in the prediction of life satisfaction by veteran judo athletes.
Material and Methods: It was used a sample of 99 Portuguese veteran judo athletes of both genders, aged between 30 and 76 years (M = 42.61 ±9.75), where through questionnaires were measured: basic psychological needs satisfaction, motivation, planned behaviour variables and life satisfaction.
Results: The structural equations model showed that autonomy perception positively and significantly predicts autonomous motivation. In its turn it positively and significantly predicts intentions.
Conclusions: Life satisfaction is positively and significantly predicted by intentions. Results authorise to emphasise the importance of fostering autonomy, since this will favour autonomous motivation, promoting a higher behavioural control over the practitioners’ intentions, thus generating a higher life satisfaction.info:eu-repo/semantics/publishedVersio TCC (Graduação) - Universidade Federal de Santa Catarina.   Centro de Desportos. Curso de Graduação em Educação Física.Durante a performance é exigido do atleta um excelente preparo físico, quando abandonam o esporte passam pelo processo de destreinamento. Esse processo consiste na redução das cargas de treinamento procurando obter os benefícios da atividade física para a saúde. Além da atividade física o estilo de vida é fundamental para determinar uma percepção de bem-estar positiva. O objetivo desse estudo foi identificar e verificar se existe associação entre o nível de atividade física e a percepção de bem-estar de ex-atletas de atletismo e futebol de campo. Será que os ex-atletas mantém níveis suficientes de atividade física para a saúde? Qual será a percepção de bem-estar desses ex-atletas? A amostra, selecionada por conveniência (facilidade de acesso) foi constituída de 30 ex-atletas de atletismo e 21 ex-atletas de futebol de campo com média de idade de 46,5 anos (±6,42 anos) que pararam competir, no mínimo, há 5 anos. Os ex-atletas responderam ao Questionário Internacional de Atividade Física - IPAQ, versão curta e o Perfil do Estilo de Vida Individual – PEVI proveniente do modelo do Pentáculo do bem-estar. Os resultados evidenciaram que 88,2% dos ex-atletas possuíam níveis suficientes de atividade física. Em relação ao nível de atividade física não foram encontradas diferenças estatisticamente significativas (p > 0,05) entre as modalidades. A maioria dos ex-atletas apresentou um Perfil do Estilo de Vida Individual positivo (78,4%, sendo 80% de ex-atletas de atletismo e 76,2% de futebol). Na comparação do PEVI entre as modalidades verificaram-se diferenças significantes em dois componentes: o comportamento preventivo positivo dos ex-atletas de atletismo foi superior ao verificado em ex-atletas de futebol de campo (100% versus 52,4%; p0,05). Na associação entre o NAF e o PEVI verificou-se uma relação direta e positiva, os ex-atletas que apresentaram níveis suficientes de atividade física (86,7%) também obtiveram PEVI positivo. Concluiu-se que a maioria dos ex-atletas participantes do estudo eram suficientemente ativos e possuíam um perfil do estilo de vida individual positivo. Os ex-atletas de atletismo apresentavam um maior comportamento preventivo positivo e os ex-atletas de futebol de campo melhor relacionamento social. De modo geral os ex-atletas mais ativos possuíam um estilo de vida mais positivo. Sugere-se que a ação dos profissionais de educação física seja mais efetiva durante a fase de aposentadoria do atleta, orientando e motivando na manutenção de hábitos saudáveis El presente trabajo estudia las percepciones con relación al potencial de liderazgo de atletas hombres y mujeres, evaluando particularmente como aquellos que sostienen un sesgo sutil hacia las mujeres influencian estas percepciones. Se evaluaron doscientos treinta y un participantes (n = 231), atletas hombres o mujeres (en un deporte de género neutro o género especifico) u hombres o mujeres no atletas, con relación a su  potencial de liderazgo en un contexto simulado de empleo. Adicionalmente, se midió el nivel de sexismo entre los participantes. Se analizaron los resultados para evaluar la interacción entre participación en deportes, sexo del postulante y nivel de sexismo del participante. Por sí misma, la participación en deportes no afectó el puntaje de potencial de liderazgo de las mujeres  postulantes a un trabajo, sin embargo, los hallazgos apoyaron la presencia de un sutil sesgo hacia las atletas y no atletas mujeres, entre cierto tipo de evaluadores. Específicamente, los evaluadores que calificaron más alto en sexismo, tendieron a evaluar a las mujeres atletas tan alto en potencial de liderazgo como a las mujeres no atletas. Estos hallazgos se discuten en el contexto de la teoría de congruencia de rol Este estudo realizou-se com 177 atletas de futsal portugueses. Procurou-se verificar se atletas com um passado desportivo de sucesso com os treinadores (n = 62, 35%) se diferenciavam dos atletas sem esse passado desportivo (n = 115, 65%), na avaliação da liderança, satisfação e compatibilidade com treinadores. O protocolo de avaliação incluiu medidas de estilos de liderança, satisfação com liderança e compatibilidade treinador-atleta. Os resultados comparativos demonstraram que os atletas com passado desportivo de sucesso avaliaram mais positivamente os treinadores em seis dimensões de liderança, assumiram maior satisfação com o tratamento pessoal e demonstraram maior compatibilidade com os seus treinadores. As análises de regressão demonstram a importância das variáveis de liderança na predição da satisfação com a liderança e da compatibilidade treinador-atleta, com particular importância para a instrução técnica e para o respeito pessoal. Resumindo, comprovou-se a importância dos resultados desportivos na forma como os atletas percecionam os respetivos treinadores"	['8003693', '18439654', '45386635', '39134860', '45573109', '18419907', '69572312', '9820454']	[[{'name': 'Arbab-Zadeh'}, {'name': 'Brosnan'}, {'name': 'Corrado'}, {'name': 'Dores'}, {'name': 'Drezner'}, {'name': 'Drezner'}, {'name': 'Drezner'}, {'name': 'Friedmann'}, {'name': 'Gademan'}, {'name': 'Gati'}, {'name': 'Koch'}, {'name': 'Lang'}, {'name': 'Maron'}, {'name': 'Papadakis'}, {'name': 'Pelliccia'}, {'name': 'Pelliccia'}, {'name': 'Pelliccia'}, {'name': 'Pelliccia'}, {'name': 'Rawlins'}, {'name': 'Sharma'}, {'name': 'Sharma'}, {'name': 'Sheikh'}, {'name': 'Wilson'}], [{'name': 'Carvalho, Ricardo Antonio Torrado de'}, {'name': 'Haas, Celia Maria'}], [{'name': 'Branco, Marco A.

dd1032ae-f3e8-4ed2-b9a8-3ef173c79741	biology	There is a clear need to establish and validate new methodologies to more quickly and efficiently screen chemicals for potential toxic effects, particularly on development. The emergence of alternative animal systems for rapid toxicology screens presents valuable opportunities to evaluate how systems complement each other. In this article, we compare a chemical library of 87-compounds in two such systems, developing zebrafish and freshwater planarians, by screening for developmental neurotoxic effects. We show that the systems’ toxicological profiles are complementary to each other, with zebrafish yielding more detailed morphological endpoints and planarians more behavioral endpoints. Overall, zebrafish was more sensitive to this chemical library, yielding 86/87 hits, compared to 50/87 hits in planarians. The difference in sensitivity could not be attributed to molecular weight, Log Kow or the bioconcentration factor. Of the 87 chemicals, 28 had previously been evaluated in mammalian developmental neuro- (DNT), neuro- or developmental toxicity studies. Of the 28, 20 were hits in the planarian, and 27 were hits in zebrafish. Eighteen of the 28 had previously been identified as DNT hits in mammals and were highly associated with activity in zebrafish and planarian behavioral assays in this study. Only 1 chemical (out of 28) was a false negative in both zebrafish and planarian systems. Differences in endpoint coverage and system sensitivity illustrate the value of a dual systems approach to rapidly query a large chemical-bioactivity space and provide weight-of-evidence for prioritization of chemicals for further testing The expression of three gap junction (GJ) proteins, alpha-1 (Cx43), beta-1 (Cx32), and beta-2 (Cx26), and their transcripts were examined during the ontogeny of the mouse and rat kidney. These proteins were expressed in two non-overlapping patterns. The alpha-1 GJ protein was first observed in mesenchymal cells in the 12-day mouse kidney. By day 14 and thereafter, the ai protein was detected in the transient S-shaped bodies, but not in the podocytes of the maturing glomeruli. After birth the antigen was retained in a small subset of secretory tubules.The beta-1 and beta-2 GJ proteins were similar in their developmental patterns. They were first detected in a small subset of secretory tubules in the subcortical zone of day 17 embryos. These tubules were identified by immunohistochemical markers to be proximal. At birth, practically all proximal tubules expressed the two antigens.This analysis of GJ proteins was consistent with the results of S1 nuclease protection assays showing that, while the alpha-1 mRNA appeared early during kidney development and declined around birth, the two beta mRNAs appeared later and became intensified during the last days of intrauterine development.In experimentally induced metanephric mesenchymes, a transient expression of the alpha-1 GJ protein was seen during the segregation of the tubular anlagen. beta-1 and beta-2 GJ proteins were not detected in such induced mesenchymes cultivated up to 7 days.These observations provide evidence for the cell-specific utilization of different GJ genes during different stages of kidney organogenesis. The alpha-1 gene is activated during the early segregation of the secretory tubule and might contribute to its compartmentalization, while the beta-1 and beta-2 gene products are not detected until advanced stages of development. The latter gene products might be correlated with the physiological activity of the proximal tubules in vivo, as they are not expressed in experimentally induced tubules detectable with markers for proximal tubules Cancer and ageing are often said to be diseases of development. During the past fifty years, the genetic components of cancer and ageing have been intensely investigated since development, itself, was seen to be an epiphenomenon of the genome. However, as we have learned more about the expression of the genome, we find that differences in expression can be as important as differences in alleles. It is easier to inactivate a gene by methylation than by mutation, and given that appropriate methylation is essential for normal development, one can immediately see that diseases would result as a consequence of inappropriate epigenetic methylation. While first proposed by Boris Vanyushin in 1973, recent studies have confirmed that inappropriate methylation not only causes diseases, and it also may be the critical factor in ageing and cancers Developmental biology is the science connecting genetics with anatomy, making sense out of both. The body builds itself from the instructions of the inherited DNA and the cytoplasmic system that interprets the DNA into genes and creates intracellular and cellular networks to generation the observable phenotype. Even ecological factors such as diet and stress may modify the DNA such that different phenotypes can be constructed from the same DNA. During the past two decades, the basic principles of development have become known; although this brief chapter cannot do them justice (see, for example, Gilbert, 2013), they cover the following: mechanisms of differential gene expression; combinatorial logic of enhancers and promoters; signal-transduction pathways linking cell membrane and nucleus; mechanisms by which syndromes occur; the repertoire of morphogenetic interactions and the molecules causing them; environmental agents of phenotype production	['62529379', '42984896', '42984865', '42984853', '37590614', '42984832', '37588082']	[[{'name': 'Collins, Eva-Maria S.'}, {'name': 'Hagstrom, D.'}, {'name': 'Tanguay, R.'}, {'name': 'Truong, L.'}, {'name': 'Zhang, S.'}], [{'name': 'Gilbert, Scott F.'}, {'name': 'Gilula, N.

A total of 12 cycling cows were subjected to blood and matched fecal sampling twice a week for 9 weeks. The concentrations of plasma P4 and fecal progestins extracted using a modified technique, were determined by a P4 radioimmunoassay (RIA) kit. There was a significant positive correlation between the concentrations of fecal progestins and plasma P4 (r = 0.6, P<0.01), as tested for the whole group except one animal. High performance liquid chromatographic separation of fecal extracts and subsequent radioimmunoassay revealed presence of four immunoreactive progestins against the P4 antibodies. These results imply that the non-invasive measure of fecal progestins using a DSL-3900 RIA kit can be used to monitor the ovarian activity in beef cows Interactions between steroid hormone receptors and signal transducer and activator of transcription (Stat)-mediated signaling pathways have already been described. In the present study, we explored the capacity of progestins to modulate Stat3 transcriptional activation in an experimental model of hormonal carcinogenesis in which the synthetic progestin medroxyprogesterone acetate (MPA) induced mammary adenocarcinomas in BALB/c mice and in the human breast cancer cell line T47D. We found that C4HD epithelial cells, from the MPA-induced mammary tumor model, expressed Stat3 and that MPA treatment of C4HD cells up-regulated Stat3 protein expression. In addition, MPA induced rapid, nongenomic Stat3, Jak1, and Jak2 tyrosine phosphorylation in C4HD and T47D cells. MPA treatment of C4HD cells also resulted in rapid c-Src tyrosine phosphorylation. These effects were completely abolished by the progestin antagonist RU486. Abrogation of Jak1 and Jak2 activity by transient transfection of C4HD cells with dominant negative (DN) Jak1 or DN Jak2 vectors, or inhibition of Src activity by preincubation of cells with the Src family kinase inhibitor PP2, blocked the capacity of MPA to induce Stat3 phosphorylation. Treatment of C4HD cells with MPA induced Stat3 binding to DNA. In addition, MPA promoted strong Stat3 transcriptional activation in C4HD and T47D cells that was inhibited by RU486 and by blockage of Jak1, Jak2, and Src activities. To investigate the correlation between MPA-induced Stat3 activation and cell growth, C4HD cells were transiently transfected with a DN Stat3 expression vector, Stat3Y705-F, or with a constitutively activated Stat3 mutant, Stat3-C. While expression of Stat3Y705-F mutant had an inhibitory effect on MPA-induced growth of C4HD cells, transfection with the constitutively activated Stat3-C vector resulted in MPA-independent proliferation. Finally, we addressed the effect of targeting Stat3 in in vivo growth of C4HD breast tumors. Blockage of Stat3 activation by transfection of C4HD cells with the DN Stat3Y705-F expression vector significantly inhibited these cells' ability to form tumors in syngeneic mice. Our results have for the first time demonstrated that progestins are able to induce Stat3 transcriptional activation, which is in turn an obligatory requirement for progestin stimulation of both in vitro and in vivo breast cancer growth.Fil: Proietti Anastasi, Cecilia Jazmín.

In contrast, most of the spontaneous, chemically or MMTV induced tumors, as well as tumors arising in genetically modified mice do not express hormone receptors. We developed a model of breast cancer in which the administration of medroxyprogesterone acetate (MPA) to BALB/c female mice induces mammary ductal carcinomas with a mean latency of 52 weeks and an incidence of about 80%. These tumors are hormone-dependent, metastatic, express both ER and PR, and are maintained by syngeneic transplants. The model has been further refined to include mammary carcinomas that evolve through different stages of hormone dependency, as well as several hormone-responsive cell lines. In this review, we describe the main features of this tumor model, highlighting the role of PR as a trigger of key signaling pathways mediating tumor growth. In addition, we discussthe relevance of this model in comparison with other currently used breast cancer models pointing out its advantages and limitations and how, this model may be suitable to unravel key questions in breast cancer.Fil: Lanari, Claudia Lee Malvina.

National Institute Of Health; Estados Unido Effects of female steroid hormones on endothelial cells are gaining increased importance due to several studies on the effects of hormonal treatment on cardiovascular risk. Recent data argue for an improvement of endothelium-derived relaxation and impaired vascular contraction by estradiol, whereas progesterone and testosterone might entail contrary effects. So far, gestagenic influence on endothelial cell physiology is poorly understood. Human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) exposed to the female sex hormones estradiol and progesterone show expression of estrogen receptor-beta (ER beta) and progesterone receptor A (PR-A), and are negative for ER alpha and PR-B. The aim of this study was to analyze the expression and stimulation of PR-A and -B in HUVECs after stimulation with progesterone and PR antagonists that are commercially available. PR-B expression or upregulation was abrogated after application of progesterone or antagonists to HUVECs. Expression of PR-A could be significantly upregulated with progesterone and mifepristone. Unexpectedly, stimulation with the progesterone antagonist RU486 (mifepristone) was accomplished by an upregulation of PR-A expression in our study. We conclude that gestagenic effects on HUVECs independent of modulators are mediated via the PR-A. Copyright (C) 2009 S.

The development of e-skin is challenging as, unlike other artificial organs, tactile skin has large number of different types of sensors, which are distributed over large areas and generate large amount of data. On top of this, the attributes such as softness, stretchability, and bendability etc., are difficult to be achieved as today's electronics technology is meant for electronics on planar and stiff substrates such as silicon wafers. This said, many advances, pursued through “More than Moore” technology, have recently raised hope as some of these relate to flexible electronics and have been targeted towards developing e-skin. Depending on the technology and application, the scale of e-skin could vary from small patch (e.g. for health monitoring) to large area skin (e.g. for robotics). This invited paper presents some of the advances in large area e-skin and flexible electronics, particularly related to robotics With the development of science and technology, artificial intelligence technology has been tried to be applied to all aspects of tumor radiotherapy, including respiratory motion prediction during simulated positioning, delineation of dangerous organs and tumor targets, and prediction of dose distribution. At present, clinical radiotherapy is mainly used in the automatic delineation of endangered organs, and artificial intelligence has demonstrated high accuracy in the delineation of dangerous organs, but there are also certain limitations. This article reviews the application and shortcomings of artificial systems in the automatic delineation of dangerous organs Complex mechanical forces generated in the growing embryo play an important role in organogenesis. Computerized application of similar forces to differentiating skeletal muscle myoblasts in vitro generate three dimensional artificial muscle organs. These organs contain parallel networks of long unbranched myofibers organized into fascicle-like structures. Tendon development is initiated and the muscles are capable of performing directed, functional work. Kinetically engineered organs provide a new method for studying the growth and development of normal and diseased skeletal muscle Various biomaterials have been widely used for manufacturing biomedical applications including artificial organs, medical devices and disposable clinical apparatus, such as vascular prostheses, blood pumps, artificial kidney, artificial hearts, dialyzers and plasma separators, which could be used in contact with blood^1^. However, the research tasks of improving hemocompatibility of biomaterials have been carrying out with the development of biomedical requirements^2^. Since the interactions that lead to surface-induced thrombosis occurring at the blood-biomaterial interface become a reason of familiar current complications with grafts therapy, improvement of the blood compatibility of artificial polymer surfaces is, therefore a major issue in biomaterials science^3^. After decades of focused research, various approaches of modifying biomaterial surfaces through chemical or biochemical methods to improve their hemocompatibility were obtained^1^. In this article, we report that polystyrene nanotube films with morphology similar to the papilla on lotus leaf can be used as blood-contacted biomaterials by virtue of Lotus effect^4^. Clearly, this idea, resulting from geometric bionics that mimicking the structure design of lotus leaf, is very novel technique for preparation of hemocompatible biomaterials ""In this paper, I will anatomize some relationships between artificial organs and ' cyborgization ' in healthcare. Nowadays, many kinds of artificial organs are practically used to help not a few patients. Can we call any person who lives with some artificial organs a cyborg? Or could we call him/her a robot? At present, we might call him/her a cyborg. But, we could not call them a robot, because a cyborg is a symbiotic creature that is part human, part machine; a robot, on the other hand, is nothing but a machine. Firstly, I will try to arrange a compact concept of ' cyborg ' referring mainly to Heilinger & Mueller ' s requirements for being a cyborg. In order to be called a cyborg, what kind of machine (or equipment) must a host human have? Here, I call it a ' machine-for-cyborg. ' Then I propose the three necessary conditions, as follows: 1 ) the ' machine-for-cyborg ' must be embedded totally or partially in the host human body; 2 ) it should not consist of cells of living things (humans, animals or plants) ; and, 3 ) it can function actively (not passively) and collaboratively with its host. Secondly, I will try to sort main artificial organs into some ' machine-for- cyborgs ' and the others. Finally, I will briefly illustrate some correlation and difference between a cyborg and a robot. For instance, we can imagine that the ultimate cyborg that would be cyborgized unlimitedly could be replaced entirely with such ' machines ' or artificial organs: we could call this ultimate cyborg a type of robot (I named the process ' robotization ' of a cyborg.) This change will show another matter of the cyborgization which concerns the quality of life (of cyborg) that represents ' human rights ' and questions how far we can or should ethically ' cyborgize ' patients or treat them by using artificial organs.

through measurements of complex electric capacitance. During isothermal aging
process the real part of the electric capacitance increases with aging time,
while the imaginary part decreases with aging time. This result suggests that
the aging time dependence of the real and imaginary parts are mainly associated
with change in thickness and dielectric permittivity, respectively. In thin
films, the thickness depends on thermal history of aging even above the glass
transition. Memory and `rejuvenation' effects are also observed in the thin
films.Comment: 4 pages, 2 figure Hogg Foundation for Mental Healt Using a local randomized experiment that arises from a sharp discontinuity in Disability Insurance (DI) policy in Norway, we provide transparent and credible identification of how financial incentives induce DI recipients to return to work. We find that many DI recipients have considerable capacity to work that can be effectively induced by providing financial work incentives. We further show that providing work incentives to DI recipients may both increase their disposable income and reduce program costs. Our findings also suggest that targeted policies may be the most effective in encouraging DI recipients to return to work It is now increasingly realized that the underlying mechanisms which govern aging is a complex interplay of genetic regulation and damage accumulation. Aging as a result of accumulation of &#x2018;faults&#x2019; on cellular and molecular levels, has been proposed in the damage (fault)-accumulation theory by Kirkwood 2006. However, this theory fails to explain some aging phenotypes such as fibrosis and premature aging, since terms such as &#x2018;damage&#x2019; and &#x2018;fault&#x2019; are not specified. Therefore we introduce here a specification of the underlying mechanism of aging and arrive at a novel theory: aging of the body is a result of the accumulation of Misrepair of tissue. It emphasizes: a) it is Misrepair, not the original damage, that accumulates and leads to aging; and b) aging can occur at different levels, however aging of the body takes place at least on the tissue level, but not necessarily on cellular/molecular level. The novel concept of Misrepair introduced here unifies the understanding of the roles of environmental damage, repair, gene regulation, and multicellular structure in the aging process. The Misrepair-accumulation theory introduced in the present paper gives explanations for the aging phenotypes, premature aging, and the difference of longevity in different species, and is consistent with the point of view of physical theory of complex systems 1_sm64ucz"	['579979', '33903897', '78776856', '74257145', '6723316', '313079', '57010636']	[[{'name': 'Fukao, Koji'}, {'name': 'Koizumi, Hiroki'}], [{'name': 'Adelberg, Bettina'}, {'name': 'Lelong, Jacqueline'}, {'name': 'Smith, Bert Kruger'}], [{'name': 'Parole Preparation Project'}, {'name': 'Release Aging People in Prison Campaign'}], [{'name': 'UNH Center on Aging and Community Living'}], [{'name': 'Kostøl, AR'}, {'name': 'Mogstad, M'}], [{'name': 'Arne Wunderlin'}, {'name': 'Jicun Wang'}, {'name': 'Ravi Mahadeva'}, {'name': 'Thomas Michelitsch'}], [{'name': 'Healthy Aging Lab'}]]	"['Aging phenomena in polystyrene thin films', 'Aging Parents & Dilemmas of Their Children', 'New York State Parole Board: Failures in Staffing and Performance', 'Person-Centered Care Provider Tip Sheet', 'How financial incentives induce disability insurance recipients to return to work', 'Aging as a consequence of misrepair -- A novel theory of aging', 'I\'m an international student.

College students all around the country have encounters with peers, in which they are pressured to consume alcohol or other substances. This research project investigates the extent to which gender and social anxiety influence an individual\u27s likelihood to conform to peer pressure in the context of substance use. Conformity to peer pressure and its relationship to substance use is a critical area of study due to its implications for public health, prevention strategies, and gender-specific interventions. We will be assessing the potential of social anxiety and peer pressure influencing binge drinking on college campuses. We expect that (1) peer pressure will act on social anxiety to lower inhibitions, such that higher social anxiety will be more easily influenced by peer pressure, (2) biological females with high social anxiety will be more likely to conform to peer pressure than biological males, (3) there will be gender differences in substance use related to peer pressure. By identifying potential vulnerabilities and protective factors unique to each gender, health professionals, educators, and policymakers can better address the complex relationship between gender, peer pressure, and substance abuse. Participants were Murray State University students, 18 years or older who had access to Murray State’s SONA application. Participation is voluntary and everyone must provide consent before moving forward with the survey. The study consists of four scales related to peer pressure and substance use. Work is in progress and is currently in the data collection phase.
Keywords: Social Anxiety, Peer Pressure, Substance Use, Binge Drinking We present a dynamic two-period model of individual behaviour with heterogeneous agents in which individuals decide how to allocate their disposable time between education, crime and work in the legal sector. Education has a multiple role: it implies higher expected wages in the legal sector, increasing the opportunity cost of committing crime and it has a sort of “civilization” effect that makes more costly to engage in criminal activities. We model this effect by introducing a peer pressure function.Crime, Education, Peer Pressure While confounding factors typically jeopardize the possibility of using observational data to measure peer effects, field experiments over the potential for obtaining clean evidence. In this paper we measure the output of subjects who were asked to stuff letters into envelopes, with a remuneration completely independent of output. We study two treatments. In the """"pair"""" treatment two subjects work at the same time in the same room. Peer effects are possible in this situation and imply that outputs within pairs should be similar. In the """"single"""" treatment, which serves as a control, subjects work alone in a room and peer effects are ruled out by design. Our main results are as follows: First, we find clear and unambiguous evidence for the existence of peer effects in the pair treatment. The standard deviations of output are significantly smaller within pairs than between pairs. Second, average output in the pair treatment largely exceeds output in the single treatment, i.e., peer effects raise productivity. Third, low productivity workers are significantly more sensitive to the behavior of peers than are high productivity workers. Our findings yield important implications for the design of the workplace.peer effects, field experiments, incentives Framed from a framework based on the integration of self-determination theory (Ryan &amp; Deci, 2000) and Endler and Parker’s (1990) conception of coping strategies, the authors analyzed the relationships between peer pressure and binge behaviors (binge eating and binge drinking) in adolescence. Moreover, the authors explored the mediating role of satisfaction/frustration of basic psychological needs and coping strategies in these associations. Participants were 570 high school students (M = 15.75 years, SD = 1.14 years) living in Italy. The study design was cross-sectional and adolescents were administered self-report questionnaires. Path analysis showed significant and positive direct associations of peer pressure with both binge eating and binge drinking. Moreover, findings show that there is an indirect path in which peer pressure is positively associated with need frustration that is related to the use of emotion-oriented coping strategies that, on their turn, are associated with binge eating. Differently, binge drinking seems to be only directly related to peer pressure. The authors put light to the complex nature of the relationships between peer pressure and binge behaviors in adolescence, taking into account the separate contribution of need satisfaction and need frustration, as well as of coping strategies. Finally, practical implications of the study are discussed This paper studies the effects of peer pressure on incentives. We assume that, in addition to the material payoff, each agent's utility includes the psychological payoff from peer pressure generated by a comparison of effort costs. We show that the optimal incentive schemes depend mainly on the degree of peer pressure and of the heterogeneity of agents. Furthermore, we examine the optimal organizational forms in terms of the principal''s intention to make use of the effects of peer pressure.Heterogeneity Abstract
This study examined how peer pressure influences participant’s attribution of blame to Black or White youth committing a crime. Participants read one of four scenarios in which a Black or White male (Kevin), who was or was not under peer pressure, stole a bicycle. To measure the amount of blame participants assigned to the adolescent, they completed a blame attribution inventory. Participants also completed a personality scale to measure their perceptions of the adolescent’s personal characteristics. To avoid being perceived as prejudiced, the researchers predicted participants would blame the White adolescent more than the Black adolescent for stealing the bicycle. Additionally, the researchers predicted that participants would blame the adolescent under peer pressure less than the adolescent not under peer pressure, regardless of race. Finally, the researchers hypothesized that participants would blame the Black adolescent less than the White adolescent in the presence of peer pressure. As predicted, participants blamed the White adolescent more than the Black adolescent, regardless of peer pressure and blamed the adolescent less when under peer pressure, regardless of race. Additionally, in the peer pressure condition, the White adolescent was blamed more than the Black adolescent. There was no interaction between the adolescent’s race and peer pressure We present results from a real-effort experiment, simulating actual work-place conditions, comparing the productivity of workers under fixed wages and piece rates. Workers, who were paid to enter data, were exposed to different degrees of peer pressure under both payment systems. The peer pressure was generated in the form of private information about the productivity of their peers. We have two main results. First, we find no level of peer pressure for which the productivity of either male or female workers is significantly higher than productivity without peer pressure. Second, we find that very low and very high levels of peer pressure can significantly decrease productivity (particularly for men paid fixed wages). These results are consistent with models of conformism and self-motivation.Peer effects, fixed wages, piece rates, gender"	['150783379', '2896878', '2990664', '46300999', '2575088', '63010407', '2629326']	[[{'name': 'Hurst, Mary'}], [{'name': 'Paolo Buonanno'}], [{'name': 'Andrea Ichino'}, {'name': 'Armin Falk'}], [{'name': 'Costa S.'}, {'name': 'Ingoglia S.'}, {'name': 'Inguglia, C.'}, {'name': 'Liga F'}], [{'name': 'Kohei Daido'}], [{'name': 'Kelly, Leah'}, {'name': 'Miller, Chloe'}, {'name': 'Park, Lauren'}, {'name': 'Richman, Maya'}, {'name': 'Scott, Samantha'}], [{'name': 'Bruce Shearer'}, {'name': 'Charles Bellemare'}, {'name': 'Patrick Lepage'}]]	"['Substance Use, Gender Differences, and Peer Influence Among College Students', 'Crime, Education and Peer Pressure', 'Clean Evidence on Peer Pressure', ""Associations Between Peer Pressure and Adolescents' Binge Behaviors: The Role of Basic Needs and Coping"", 'Incentive Effects of Peer Pressure in Organizations', '“See, I’m not racist!”: Aversive Racism, Peer Pressure, and Blaming Adolescents', 'Peer Pressure, Incentives, and Gender: an Experimental Analysis of Motivation in the Workplace']"	7.0	exploratory	0.5

e23e2047-bf64-4a11-874d-968779fa43a4	toponyms	"Recogito is an open source tool for the semi-automatic annotation of place references in maps and texts. It was developed as part of the Pelagios 3 research project, which aims to build up a comprehensive directory of places referred to in early maps and geographic writing predating the year 1492. Pelagios 3 focuses specifically on sources from the Classical Latin, Greek and Byzantine periods; on Mappae Mundi and narrative texts from the European Medieval period; on Late Medieval Portolans; and on maps and texts from the early Islamic and early Chinese traditions. Since the start of the project in September 2013, the team has harvested more than 120,000 toponyms, manually verifying almost 60,000 of them. Furthermore, the team held two public annotation workshops supported through the Open Humanities Awards 2014. In these workshops, a mixed audience of students and academics of different backgrounds used Recogito to add several thousand contributions on each workshop day.



A number of benefits arise out of this work: on the one hand, the digital identification of places – and the names used for them – makes the documents' contents amenable to information retrieval technology, i.e. documents become more easily search- and discoverable to users than through conventional metadata-based search alone. On the other hand, the documents are opened up to new forms of re-use. For example, it becomes possible to “map” and compare the narrative of texts, and the contents of maps with modern day tools like Web maps and GIS; or to analyze and contrast documents’ geographic properties, toponymy and spatial relationships. Seen in a wider context, we argue that initiatives such as ours contribute to the growing ecosystem of the “Graph of Humanities Data” that is gathering pace in the Digital Humanities (linking data about people, places, events, canonical references, etc.), which has the potential to open up new avenues for computational and quantitative research in a variety of fields including History, Geography, Archaeology, Classics, Genealogy and Modern Languages The Maltese islands have been dominated by various rulers who left an imprint on the life, customs, and language of the inhabitants. This is evident also in the toponymy of the archipelago. The names of places, towns, and villages of the larger island, Malta, provide interesting samples of these admixtures. The names of the town and villages of Gozo are no exception. The legal name of the capital, Victoria, reflects the very recent history of the islands; Malta under British rule. However, its older one, Rabat, and most of the names of the villages and smaller inhabited areas, corroborate the dominating Semitic element in the Maltese language, and the mixed history of the islands and their people. This paper gives a hypothetical etymology, together with a descriptive linguistic picture, of each of the names, and discusses the relationship each has within the prismatic context of the Maltese language, but especially toponymy.peer-reviewe The traditional model for geospatial crowd sourcing asks the public to use their free time collecting geospatial data for no obvious reward. This model has shown to work very well on projects such as Open Street Map, but comes with some clear disadvantages such as reliance on small communities of ‘Neo-geographers’ and variability in quality and content of collected data. This project aims at tackling these problems by providing alternative motivation specifically a smartphone based computer game service. Geographical names (vernacular names/ toponyms) have been identified as potential targets as they are difficult to collect on a large scale and easy to collect locally, thus ideal for crowd sourcing. The data set will be a toponyms database provided by the Spanish National Geographic Institute (IGN Spain). A location based game is targeted as it is easy to guide data collection with in-game rewards (prizes, points, badges etc.). Android is chosen for its accessible API and wide use Named entity extraction and disambiguation have received much attention in recent years. Typical fields addressing these topics are information retrieval, natural language processing, and semantic web. Although these topics are highly dependent, almost no existing works examine this dependency. It is the aim of this paper to examine the dependency and show how one affects the other, and vice versa. We conducted experiments with a set of descriptions of holiday homes with the aim to extract and disambiguate toponyms as a representative example of named entities. We experimented with three approaches for disambiguation with the purpose to infer the country of the holiday home. We examined how the effectiveness of extraction influences the effectiveness of disambiguation, and reciprocally, how filtering out ambiguous names (an activity that depends on the disambiguation process) improves the effectiveness of extraction. Since this, in turn, may improve the effectiveness of  disambiguation again, it shows that extraction and disambiguation may reinforce each other.\u The  present  work  is  focused  on  toponyms  of  recent  creation.  These  new  place  
names have generally received less attention among scholars than those with a long 
history, which have often generated passionate debates and academic papers about 
their  origins.  The  group  analyzed  here  was  discarded  from  the  index  list  resulting  
from a toponymy survey made in the village of Gata (Cáceres) in 2014. They are less 
than one hundred years old, and do not appear to be registered as toponyms in any 
known written source. However, their analysis reveals that the necessity for a social 
community to give names to the places it inhabits, and the process for the creation 
of new toponyms has essentially not changed for centuries.El presente trabajo se centra en los topónimos de reciente creación. Este grupo ha

Meteorite water release profiles show significant differences to expected reference minerals Chimpanzees of the Sonso community, Budongo Forest, Uganda were observed eating clay and drinking clay-water from waterholes. We show that clay, clay-rich water, and clay obtained with leaf sponges, provide a range of minerals in different concentrations. The presence of aluminium in the clay consumed indicates that it takes the form of kaolinite. We discuss the contribution of clay geophagy to the mineral intake of the Sonso chimpanzees and show that clay eaten using leaf sponges is particularly rich in minerals. We show that termite mound soil, also regularly consumed, is rich in minerals. We discuss the frequency of clay and termite soil geophagy in the context of the disappearance from Budongo Forest of a formerly rich source of minerals, the decaying pith of Raphia farinifera palms Major decisions an the use and disposition of land in Alaska are being made by the State and Federal governments.

polyelectrolyte bundles, via grand-canonical Monte Carlo simulations. Following
recent experiments we use linear, rigid divalent cations of various lengths to
induce condensation. Our results clarify and explain the experimental results
for short cations. For longer cations we observe novel condensation behavior
owing to alignment of the cations. We also study the role of the
polyelectrolyte surface charge density, and find a nonmonotonic variation in
bundle stability. This nonmonotonicity captures two trends that have been
observed in separate experiments.Comment: To appear in Physical Review Letter Cations play key roles in regulating G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs), although their mechanisms are poorly understood. Here, 19F NMR is used to delineate the effects of cations on functional states of the adenosine A2A GPCR. While Na+ reinforces an inactive ensemble and a partial-agonist stabilized state, Ca2+ and Mg2+ shift the equilibrium toward active states. Positive allosteric effects of divalent cations are more pronounced with agonist and a G-protein-derived peptide. In cell membranes, divalent cations enhance both the affinity and fraction of the high affinity agonist-bound state. Molecular dynamics simulations suggest high concentrations of divalent cations bridge specific extracellular acidic residues, bringing TM5 and TM6 together at the extracellular surface and allosterically driving open the G-protein-binding cleft as shown by rigidity-transmission allostery theory. An understanding of cation allostery should enable the design of allosteric agents and enhance our understanding of GPCR regulation in the cellular milieu"	['565655', '85859446']	[[{'name': 'Camilo Guáqueta'}, {'name': 'Erik Luijten'}, {'name': 'J.\u2009X.

Let by examples like this, recently many companies decided to invest in influencers endorsing their products to uplift their sales. Yet, little is known about how influencer marketing evokes purchase behavior among individuals. To answer this question, we want to conduct an interview-based study and a configurational approach, identifying factors and configurations of factors influencing individuals’ purchase behavior in response to influencer marketing. Theoretically, we base on the elaboration likelihood model (ELM) and adapt it to the context of influencer marketing. Thereby, we expect to contribute to theory by building a contextualized ELM for influencer marketing and identifying factors resulting in purchase behavior. Further, we expect to identify configurations of factors resulting in purchase behavior, which explain how the elaboration of influencer marketing influences purchase behavior, which can be used by firms Exposure to influencer marketing of foods and beverages high in fat, sugar, and/or salt (HFSS) increases children’s immediate intake. This study qualitatively explored children’s understanding of, and attitudes towards, this marketing, to elucidate potential mechanisms through which exposure affects behavior. In six focus groups (n = 4) children (10–11 years) were shown a YouTube video featuring influencer marketing of an HFSS product. Inductive thematic analysis identified six themes from children’s discussions of this marketing: (1) YouTubers fill a gap in children’s lives, (2) the accessibility of YouTubers increases children’s understanding of their actions, (3) influencer marketing impacts all—the influencer, the brand, and the viewer, (4) attitudes towards influencer marketing are most affected by a YouTuber’s familiarity, (5) YouTuber influencer marketing is effective because they are not ‘strangers’, (6) children feel able to resist influencer marketing of HFSS products. Children had an understanding of the persuasive intent of this marketing, and although most were sceptical, familiar YouTubers elicited particularly sympathetic attitudes. Children felt affected by influencer marketing of HFSS products, but believed they were able to resist it. Beyond theoretical insight, this study adds to the growing body of evidence to suggest children’s exposure to HFSS influencer marketing should be reduced Is marketing influence the right way or not for a business? Investing in this type of marketing is advantageous or not for promoting a product or service. What type of marketing defines this strategy? We will discuss all these aspects in this paper This paper evaluates how effective influencer marketing is across the two most popular influencer platforms, YouTube and Instagram. This paper uses a case study approach to analyze popular brands that use influencer marketing on both platforms to determine which platform is more successful at engaging and reaching audiences from influencers. The brands analyzed for case studies are food delivery service HelloFresh and haircare brand Function of Beauty. Both brands use influencer marketing on Instagram and YouTube. The HelloFresh case study analyzes sponsored content from YouTube creator Jacksfilms and Instagram influencer Marisa Hen. The Function of Beauty case study analyzes sponsored content from YouTube creator Casey Aonso and Instagram influencer Destiny Rodriguez. The analysis from these case studies shows that while YouTube influencers may reach broader audiences, Instagram influencers harness more engagement across their following. Additionally, this paper acknowledges the limitations of a case study approach, which cannot provide a holistic, quantitative comparison across every brand that uses influencer marketing and every influencer on YouTube and Instagram. Thoroughly comparing these brands that use both platforms can provide marketing professionals with valuable insights into influencer marketing Purpose: This study aims to examine the ability of the social influence heuristics framework to capture skillful and creative social media influencer (SMI) marketing in long-form video content on YouTube for influencer-owned brands and products. Design/methodology/approach: The theoretical lens was a framework of seven evidence-based social influence heuristics (reciprocity, social proof, consistency, scarcity, liking, authority and unity). For the methodological lens, a qualitative case study approach was applied to a purposeful sample of 6 SMIs and 15 videos on YouTube. Findings: The evidence shows that self-promotional influencer marketing in long-form video content is relatable to all seven heuristics and shows signs of high elaboration, innovativeness and skillfulness. Research limitations/implications: The study reveals that a heuristic-based account of self-promotional influencer marketing in long-form video content can greatly contribute to the understanding of how various well-established marketing concepts (e.g. source attractivity) might be expressed in real-world communications and behaviors. Based on this improved, in-depth understanding, current research efforts, such as experimental studies using one video with a more or less arbitrary influencer and pre-post measure, are advised to explore research questions via designs that account for the observed subtle and complex nature of real-world influencer marketing in long-form video content. Practical implications: This structured account of skillful and creative marketing can be used as educational and instructive material for influencer marketing practitioners to enhance their creativity, for consumers to increase their marketing literacy and for policymakers to rethink policies for influencer marketing. Originality/value: Prior research has created a body of knowledge on influencer marketing. However, a conceptual disconnect has hampered the advancement of the field. The social influence heuristics framework is a highly functional conceptual bridge that links the qualitative and quantitative evidence and will advance the understanding of influencer marketing more effectively short, influencer marketing could be described as the use of influential personalities to promote a service, product or brand. This form of marketing is becoming more popular year by year in almost every part of the world. When reffering to influencer marketing and influencers, we mainly think of influencer influencing their target audience on social media. Anyone who has an influence over a specific audience is considered an influencer. It does not have to be only actors, singers or other celebrities, but also, for example, experts in a certain field, journalists, or social media stars. The number of fans (i.e. followers) is not always important. Cooperation with several micro-influencers can in many cases be more effective and cheaper than cooperation with one well-known influencer, especially if promoting a very specific product for a narrow target group.
The main purpose of this report is to explore the field of influencer marketing both from theoretical and practical point of view. As a part of my studies, I have undergone a 4 month internship as a influencer marketing consultant, so in this report I will summarize how is the theory applied in practice, how are influencer marketing campaigns ran and planned, and the impact of this internship on my personal development and knowledge.
Influencer marketing is a great digital marketing tool for companies, and if done right, can be quite effective, relatively inexpensive, reach a lot of new customer, or strengthen a brand image. No marketing campaign is alike, and its effectiveness will be, at the end, determined how well it was planned. In order to execute an effective influencer marketing campaign, a great deal of planning is neccessary as clear objectives has to be set, proper strategy has to be drafted, clear message needs to be articulated, or proper reporting has to be done Objectives 

The main objective of this study was to determine whether certain drivers of influencer marketing on Instagram affect the customer purchase intention in a way, in which they may be utilised to maximise the outcomes of influencer marketing efforts. In addition, another objective was to examine the perceptions of consumers regarding influencer marketing and whether these perceptions may be used to enhance influencer marketing activities.


Summary 

Overall, this thesis studies the various drivers of influencer marketing including peer influence, persuasion knowledge, market mavenism and influencers’ openness of information regarding advertisements are studied. The effects of the size of an influencer are also explored. Primary data was collected through an online survey to examine consumers’ perceptions and behaviour regarding influencer marketing on Instagram.


Conclusions

Based on the quantitative analysis, peer influence, specifically word-of-mouth, has a significant impact on customer purchase intention. Mavenism was also found to have a significant positive impact to the purchase intent, which means that the feeling of uniqueness is connected to the consumer’s buying behavior. No connection was found between consumers’ persuasion knowledge, nor the importance of advertisement openness, and the purchase intention. Overall, the research provides strategic insight to marketers determining what factors of influencer marketing should be emphasised in influencer marketing Influencer marketing has become a trendy marketing method in recent years, Influencer marketing is relatively new phenomenon, and its potential hasn’t been measured yet. Thus, marketers have started to identify people with great influence over others and have realized their market worth. In the 21st century, social media platforms have reached hundreds of millions new users, and at the same time word of mouth marketing have reached a new potential. Nowadays, consumers are able to read hundreds of online reviews, recommendations, and comments before making any consuming choices. Virtual communities are formed on multiple online platforms, and in these communities,  there are always opinion leaders influencing others behavior.

As the popularity of influencer marketing has risen, its use as part of internationalization haven’t yet been examined enough. Therefore, this paper studies usage of influencer marketing as part of internationalization. The study is conducted by examining the current literature on influencer marketing, consumer behavior, and internationalization. In addition, this paper provides a case study of an influencer marketing agency called Matchmade. The collected data was then analyzed by comparing it to the literature review.

Findings of this study shows that usage of an influencer marketing agency can get a significant global coverage for advertisers’ campaign. As the case company’s customers are mainly gaming or other web placed application companies, the results show that for the most effective advertising campaign, companies should use a significant number of small content creators in their influencer marketing campaigns In examining the rise of influencer marketing and emoji’s concurrent surge in popularity, it naturally follows that emoji should be incorporated into the FTC’s required disclosures for sponsored posts across social media platforms. While current disclosure methods the FTC recommends are easily jumbled or lost in other text, using emoji to disclose material connections would streamline disclosure requirements, leveraging an already-popular method of communication to better reach consumers. This Note proposes that the FTC adopts an emoji as a preferred method of disclosure for influencer marketing on social media. Part I discusses the rise of influencer marketing, the FTC and its history of regulating sponsored content, and the current state of regulation. Part II explores the proliferation of emoji as a method of communication, and the role of the Unicode Consortium in regulating the adoption of new emoji. Part III makes the case for incorporating emoji as a method of disclosure to bridge compliance gaps, and offers additional recommendations to increase compliance with existing regulations"	['41261377', '17828362', '8464696', '126851009', '83500060', '18721579', '138644066', '15033535', '131307021', '63045830']	[[{'name': 'Matveeva, A.'}, {'name': 'Yevseitseva, O.'}], [{'name': 'Mattke, Jens'}, {'name': 'Müller, Lea'}], [{'name': 'Boyland, EJ'}, {'name': 'Christiansen, P'}, {'name': 'Coates, AE'}, {'name': 'Halford, JCG'}, {'name': 'Hardman, CA'}], [{'name': 'Petrișor Mateuț, Oana'}], [{'name': 'Everett, Alison'}], [{'name': 'Mau, Gunnar'}, {'name': 'Rohde, Paul'}], [{'name': 'Tóth, Adam'}], [{'name': 'Honkanen, Sara'}], [{'name': 'Jämsén, Aarne Lauri Henrik'}], [{'name': 'Sauerborn, Christina'}]]	['INFLUENCER MARKETING.

Healthy individuals activate the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dACC) when experiencing social rejection, while those who are vulnerable to depression deactivate the dACC presumably to downregulate salience of rejection cues and minimize distress. Schizotypal individuals, characterized by unusual perceptual experiences and/or odd beliefs, are more rejection sensitive than normal. We tested the hypothesis, for the first time, that individuals with high schizotypy also have an altered dACC response to rejection stimuli. Twenty-six healthy individuals, 14 with low schizotypy (LS) and 12 with high schizotypy (HS), viewed depictions of rejection and acceptance and neutral scenes while undergoing functional MRI. Activation maps in LS and HS groups during each image type were compared using SPM5, and their relation to participant mood and subjective ratings of the images was examined. During rejection relative to neutral scenes, LS activated and HS deactivated the bilateral dACC, right superior frontal gyrus, and left ventral prefrontal cortex. Across both groups, a temporo-occipito-parieto-cerebellar network was active during rejection, and a left fronto-parietal network during acceptance, relative to neutral scenes, and the bilateral lingual gyrus during rejection relative to acceptance scenes. Our finding of dACC-dorso-ventral PFC activation in LS, but deactivation in HS individuals when perceiving social rejection scenes suggests that HS individuals attach less salience to and distance themselves from such stimuli. This may enable them to cope with their higher-than-normal sensitivity to rejection KEY POINTS Cross-sectional survey studies have demonstrated significant associations between parental rejection and peer rejection on the one hand and disturbed eating in youngsters, like emotional eating, on the other hand. In this study, we wanted to expand our knowledge on these relationships by investigating the daily fluctuations in these variables. Youngsters completed a 7-day diary to assess daily parental rejection, peer rejection and emotional eating. Using multilevel analyses, our results showed that daily variations in parental rejection were related to daily variations in emotional eating of the youngsters. This highlights the importance of addressing the parent-child relationship in interventions for emotional eating in youngsters.Background: This study investigated the daily relation between parental rejection and peer rejection on the one hand and emotional eating in youngsters on the other hand.Methods: Participants (N = 55) between the ages of 11 and 15 years completed a 7-day diary. A multilevel design was used to examine day-to-day within-person relationships between parental and peer rejection (measured by CHS) and emotional eating (measured by DEBQ-C) of youngsters.Results: The results showed that daily variations in parental rejection were related to daily variations in emotional eating of the youngsters. Daily peer rejection was only marginally significantly related to the emotional eating of the youngsters.Conclusions: These results indicate that especially parental rejection, and to a lesser extent peer rejection, are associated with the emotional eating of youngsters. The findings highlight the importance of addressing the parent-child relationship in interventions for emotional eating in youngsters Studying immune repertoire in the context of organ transplant provides important information on how adaptive immunity may contribute and modulate graft rejection. Here we characterize the peripheral blood immune repertoire of individuals before and after kidney transplant using B cell receptor sequencing in a longitudinal clinical study. Individuals who develop rejection after transplantation have a more diverse immune repertoire before transplant, suggesting a predisposition for post-transplant rejection risk. Additionally, over 2 years of follow-up, patients who develop rejection demonstrate a specific set of expanded clones that persist after the rejection. While there is an overall reduction of peripheral B cell diversity, likely due to increased general immunosuppression exposure in this cohort, the detection of specific IGHV gene usage across all rejecting patients supports that a common pool of immunogenic antigens may drive post-transplant rejection. Our findings may have clinical implications for the prediction and clinical management of kidney transplant rejection Rejection sensitivity is the heightened tendency to perceive or anxiously expect disengagement from others during social interaction. There has been a recent wave of neuroimaging studies of rejection. The aim of the current review was to determine key brain regions involved in social rejection by selectively reviewing neuroimaging studies that employed one of three paradigms of social rejection, namely social exclusion during a ball-tossing game, evaluating feedback about preference from peers and viewing scenes depicting rejection during social interaction. A cross the different paradigms of social rejection, there was concordance in regions for experiencing rejection, namely dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), subgenual ACC and ventral ACC. Functional dissociation between the regions for experiencing rejection and those for emotion regulation, namely medial prefrontal cortex, ventrolateral prefrontal cortex (VLPFC) and ventral striatum, was evident in the positive association between social distress and regions for experiencing rejection and the inverse association between social distress and the emotion regulation regions. The paradigms of social exclusion and scenes depicting rejection in social interaction were more adept at evoking rejection-specific neural responses. These responses were varyingly influenced by the amount of social distress during the task, social support received, self-esteem and social competence. Presenting rejection cues as scenes of people in social interaction showed high rejection sensitive or schizotypal individuals to under-activate the dorsal ACC and VLPFC, suggesting that such individuals who perceive rejection cues in others down-regulate their response to the perceived rejection by distancing themselves from the scene The idea of rejection originated by Aristotle. The notion of rejection
          was introduced into formal logic by Łukasiewicz [20]. He applied it to
          complete syntactic characterization of deductive systems using an axiomatic
          method of rejection of propositions [22, 23]. The paper gives not only genesis,
          but also development and generalization of the notion of rejection. It also
          emphasizes the methodological approach to biaspectual axiomatic method of
          characterization of deductive systems as acceptance (asserted) systems and
          rejection (refutation) systems, introduced by Łukasiewicz and developed by
          his student Słupecki, the pioneers of the method, which becomes relevant in
          modern approaches to logic Rejection is one of the key factors that determine the long-term allograft function and survival in renal transplant patients. Reliable and timely diagnosis is important to treat rejection as early as possible. Allograft biopsies are not suitable for continuous monitoring of rejection. Thus, there is an unmet need for non-invasive methods to diagnose acute and chronic rejection. Proteomics in urine and blood samples has been explored for this purpose in 29 studies conducted since 2003.

d1560023-40d7-413a-8026-67472b30edbc	prenatal	"open5noBACKGROUND:
Prenatal stress is hypothesized to have a disruptive impact on neurodevelopmental trajectories, but few human studies have been conducted on the long-term neural correlates of prenatal exposure to stress. The aim of this study was to explore the relationship between prenatal stress exposure and gray-matter volume and resting-state functional connectivity in a sample of 35 healthy women aged 14-40 years.
METHOD:
Voxel-based morphometry and functional connectivity analyses were performed on the whole brain and in specific regions of interest (hippocampus and amygdala). Data about prenatal/postnatal stress and obstetric complications were obtained by interviewing participants and their mothers, and reviewing obstetric records.
RESULTS:
Higher prenatal stress was associated with decreased gray-matter volume in the left medial temporal lobe (MTL) and both amygdalae, but not the hippocampus. Variance in gray-matter volume of these brain areas significantly correlated with depressive symptoms, after statistically adjusting for the effects of age, postnatal stress and obstetric complications. Prenatal stress showed a positive linear relationship with functional connectivity between the left MTL and the pregenual cortex. Moreover, connectivity between the left MTL and the left medial-orbitofrontal cortex partially explained variance in the depressive symptoms of offspring.
CONCLUSIONS:
In young women, exposure to prenatal stress showed a relationship with the morphometry and functional connectivity of brain areas involved in the pathophysiology of depressive disorders. These data provide evidence in favor of the hypothesis that early exposure to stress affects brain development and identified the MTL and amygdalae as possible targets of such exposure.openFavaro, Angela; Tenconi, Elena; Degortes, Daniela; Manara, R; Santonastaso, PaoloFavaro, Angela; Tenconi, Elena; Degortes, Daniela; Manara, R; Santonastaso, Paol The issue of abortion has been the topic of heated and frequent debate in post-Communist Poland. Parliamentary debate in 1998—9 centred around a legislative attempt to restrict prenatal testing, specifically amniocentesis, in order to further reduce the numbers of abortions carried out, as it was argued to inevitably result in the termination of pregnancy. Medical professionals are rarely visible as subjects of and authorities on the abortion debate in the Polish context. However, in this debate around prenatal testing, the medical community appear as key commentators and meaning-makers. This article asks the following questions: What role do the medical profession and biomedical knowledge play in the debate around prenatal testing, when abortion is highly politicized? Second, what social meanings and consequences are attributed to prenatal testing? How do these construct the relationship between foetus, pregnant woman and doctor, and what agency and 'rights' are attributed to women in the process of prenatal testing Objective: To assess the prevalence of prenatal screening and of adverse outcome in high-risk pregnancies due to maternal HIV infection. 

Study design: The prevalence of prenatal screening in 330 pregnancies of HIV-positive women attending the department for prenatal screening and/or during labour between January 1, 2002 and December 31, 2012, was recorded. Screening results were compared with the postnatal outcome and maternal morbidity, and mother-to-child transmission (MTCT) was evaluated. 

Results: One hundred of 330 women (30.5%) had an early anomaly scan, 252 (74.5%) had a detailed scan at 20–22 weeks, 18 (5.5%) had a detailed scan prior to birth, and three (0.9%) had an amniocentesis. In seven cases (2.12%), a fetal anomaly was detected prenatally and confirmed postnatally, while in eight (2.42%) an anomaly was only detected postnatally, even though a prenatal scan was performed. There were no anomalies in the unscreened group. MTCT occurred in three cases (0.9%) and seven fetal and neonatal deaths (2.1%) were reported.

Conclusion: The overall prevalence of prenatal ultrasound screening in our cohort is 74.5%, but often the opportunity for prenatal ultrasonography in the first trimester is missed. In general, the aim should be to offer prenatal ultrasonography in the first trimester in all pregnancies. This allows early reassurance or if fetal disease is suspected, further steps can be taken"	['29554205', '74246342', '7093748']	[[], [{'name': 'Kramer, Anne-Marie Caroline'}], [{'name': 'Buxmann, Horst'}, {'name': 'Haberl, Annette Elisabeth'}, {'name': 'Herrmann, Eva'}, {'name': 'Louwen, Frank'}, {'name': 'Reitter, Anke'}, {'name': 'Schlößer, Rolf Lambert'}, {'name': 'Stücker, Anja-Undine'}]]	['Neural correlates of prenatal stress in young women.', 'Defending biomedical authority and regulating the womb as social space.

Established in 1971 with just seven structures, it presently includes more than 56,000 entries. To maintain the highest standards in curation and processing, the members of the worldwide Protein Data Bank (wwPDB) collaborate in data annotation and the development of procedures, tools, and resources. Annotation-related issues, particularly those impacted by new developments&#xd;&#xa;in structural biology, are critically reviewed at in-person and virtual meetings regularly and frequently. Comprehensive documentation of the procedures, formats, and related data dictionaries used in data annotation are available at the wwPDB website(www.wwpdb.org).&#xd;&#xa;&#xd;&#xa;Mindful of the impact that changes in annotation procedures or data format may have on users, changes are carefully managed and communicated in a timely fashion. In cases involving complex scientific or policy issues, input is sought from advisory committees, standing task forces, experimental method developers, and community experts. This is exemplified by creation of the recently-released version of the PDB archive which updates and further standardizes database references, small molecule chemistry, biological assemblies, and active sites The gross features of the observed baryon excitation spectrum below 2 GeV are
well explained if the spectrum generating algebra of its intrinsic orbital
angular momentum states is o(4)*su(2)_I. The spins of the resonances are
obtained through the coupling of a Lorentz bi-spinor (1/2,0)+ (0,1/ 2) to a
multiplet of the type (j,j) in its O(4)/O(3) reduction. The parities of the
resonances follow from those of the O(3) members of the (j,j) multiplets. In
this way relativistic SL(2,C) representations are constructed. For example, the
first S11, P11, and D13 states with masses around 1500 MeV fit into the (1/2,
1/2)* [(1/2,0)+(0,1/2)] representation. The observed parities of the resonances
correspond to natural parities of the (1/2,1/2) states. The second P11, S11,
D13- together with the first P13, F15, D15, and (a predicted) F17 -resonances,
centered around 1700 MeV, are organized into the (3/2,3/2)*[(1/2,0)+(0,1/2)]
representation. I argue that the members of the (3/2,3/2) multiplet carry
unnatural parities and that in this region chiral symmetry is restored. In the
N(939)- N(1650) transition the chiral symmetry mode is changed, and therefore,
a chiral phase transition is predicted to take place.Comment: 9 pages, LaTex, 1 figure; published in Mod.Phys.Lett. A12 (1997)
  2373; minor misprints corrected, no statement change While concentration measures are a good indicator of market structure, the link with competitiveness is more complex than often assumed. In particular, the modern theory of industrial organisation makes no clear statement regarding the impact of concentration on competition - the focus of this paper is concentration and no inferences are made about competitive aspects of the market. The extent and nature of concentration within the UK listed company audit market as at April, 2002 and, pro forma, after the collapse of Andersen is documented and analysed in detail (by firm, market segment and industry sector). The largest four firms held 90 per cent of the market (based on audit fees) in 2002, rising to 96 per cent with the demise of Andersen. A single firm, Pricewaterhouse-Coopers, held 70 per cent or more of the share of six out of 38 industry sectors, with a share of 50 per cent up to 70 per cent in a further seven sectors. The provision of non-audit services (NAS) by incumbent auditors is also considered. As at April 2002, the average ratio of non-audit fees (paid to auditor) to audit fees was 208 per cent, and exceeded 300 per cent in seven sectors. It is likely, however, that disposals by firms of their management consultancy and outsource firms, combined with the impact of the Smith Report on audit committees will serve to reduce these ratios. Another finding is that audit firms with expertise in a particular sector appeared to earn significantly higher nonaudit fees from their audit clients in that sector. The paper thus provides a solid empirical basis for debate. The subsequent discussion considers the implications for companies and audit firms of the high level of concentration in the current regulatory climate, where no direct regulatory intervention is planned We derive fusion rules for the composition of $q$-deformed classical
representations (arising in tensor products of the fundamental representation)
with semi-periodic representations of $SL(N)_q$ at roots of unity. We obtain
full reducibility into semi-periodic representations. On the other hand,
heterogeneous $\cR$-matrices which intertwine tensor products of periodic or
semi-periodic representations with $q$-deformed classical representations are
given. These $\cR$-matrices satisfy all the possible Yang Baxter equations with
one another and, when they exist, with the $\cR$-matrices intertwining
homogeneous tensor products of periodic or semi-periodic representations. This
compatibility between these two kinds of representations has never been used in
physical models.Comment: 12 page This study was done to determine the effectiveness of Seasonal Malaria Chemoprevention in Senegalese children up to 10 years of age using a stepped-wedge design.

b4cc2df1-280a-4592-bee2-17273c0a6937	extracurricular activities	"Extracurricular activity is a complementary of the requirement and interest in the student academic development. Extracurricular learning styles can be implemented in the form of informal where it can provide effective learning experiences to the students. In extracurricular development, every activity has its own goals and interests that can influence the students to participate in the particular activities. Nowadays, students are more likely to engage or spending their time with unbeneficial activities or isolate themselves in the virtual world. Several studies have been conducted and found that there are factors influence or prevent the students from participating in the extracurricular activities they intended to. These factors have been categorical into three main constraints; structural constraints, intrapersonal constraints, and interpersonal constraints. These main constraints referred to many factors that can influence student participation in extracurricular activities Extracurricular activities play a significant part in students' overall development, and the long-term mechanism is critical to extracurricular activities' educational efficiency. This paper describes Huai'an No. 1 Mountain Middle School's regular extracurricular events, which include four festivals and one party, as well as the tactics used to create a long-term mechanism for the school's extracurricular activities The purpose of this study was to describe why the role of the principal in self-development of students through extracurricular activities at MIN 1 Bener Meriah, and to describe the role of  the principal in self-development of students through extracurricular activities at MIN 1 Bener Meriah. This study is a qualitative type using observational, interviews and documentation, data analysis using triangulation theory. Based on the results of the research: the role of the principal is very important in the self-development of students at MIN 1 Bener Meriah. Among these roles are (1) educator: teaching with teacher intermediaries, (2) manager: managing with POAC even though the field is narrow, (3) administrators: take care of correspondence and funding for extracurricular activities, (4) supervise extracurricular activities through joint meetings and direct involvement, (5) leaders: mobilize involved teachers and students in extracurricular activities, (6) innovator: Principals make reforms such as creative guel dance (7) motivator: the principal provides encouragement in the form of words and gifts for students who excel, including in extracurricular activities. So that the role of the principal is done well, it will also have a good impact on the development of students in the extracurricular program Any conference or round-table discussion aims to elicit a student's
language behaviour. These activities are needed both by teachers and
students to know how well somebody else uses foreign languages in free
speaking activities and how much a student needs to master his own
speaking abilities. Moreover, extracurricular activities aim to answer why
they learn foreign languages. From the first-year students to postgraduates
with more academic and professional ambitious there is one thing they have
in common – through learning foreign languages they hope to achieve a
goal to improve future professional opportunities Public education at all levels has sustained a torrent of modulation in recent years, most notably due to the repercussions from the Covid-19 global pandemic. Schools are offering more remote/online options for students as well as utilizing hybrid curriculums taking advantage of the evermore widespread availability of technology and connectivity, even in our more rural school districts. The ramifications of these modifications to the traditional classroom setting are still unknown, and as such many areas of the public education system need to be closely monitored. One such area would be extracurricular opportunities for students, especially those opting for remote/hybrid curriculums. It is well researched that there are positive academic, social, emotional, and physical effects associated with participation in extracurricular activities. This study will focus on the academic benefits, in an effort to provide information to school districts and parents so they may make informed decisions regarding the allocation of their time and resources. The focus of this study is to determine if participation in fine-arts, athletics, or both fine-arts and athletics extracurricular activities is predicting academic success as measured by student grade-point averages and student composite ACT scores. A secondary inquiry for this study is to then compare the effects of involvement in athletics and fine-arts to determine if one type of participation is reaping a more positive response with respect to academic success. To answer these questions, data were collected from the Hillsboro High School Class of 2022 on extracurricular involvement, GPA, and ACT. The data were then analyzed using statistical methods to answer the main questions listed above. This study could be the first of many to further compare various types of extracurricular activities to determine how comparable their academic effects are. The results of this study are examined in great detail in this study, however, the well-established connection of involvement predicting academic success from many similar studies in high schools is echoed by this study. Certainly, there is a positive connection between involvement in activities outside of the normal curriculum of Hillsboro High School and the academic success rates of those students How does teacher involvement in extracurricular activities affect overall school culture in high schools? This case study sought to examine high school teachers’ perceptions about their participation (or lack thereof) in extracurricular activities as well as their perceptions about whether participation in extracurricular activities has an impact on school culture. Using a mixed-methods approach, data revealed that teachers see their own extracurricular involvement as a positive way to build relationships with their students and that participating in extracurricular activities could be a beneficial way to build a positive school culture. However, teachers often struggle to participate due to time constraints and family obligations. Implications from the study reveal that involvement in extracurricular activities leads to stronger culturally responsive practices in school. At a time when culturally responsive practices are needed urgently, administrators should consider strategic ways to prioritize extracurricular involvement The purpose of this study was to investigate the relationship between participation in extracurricular activities and academic achievement.  Surveys were administered to 23 4th-8th – grade students to gather information on their extracurricular participation, and data was collected on these students’ most recent standardized test scores and first-quarter grades.  The quantitative data collected was then statistically analyzed using the SPSS program.  The results of this analysis suggest a statistically significant positive correlation between hours spent participating in extracurricular activities and cumulative GPA.  Students’ GPAs did not appear to be impacted by the total number nor types of activities in which they participated.  No significant relationship was found between students’ standardized test scores and extracurricular participation.  These results indicate a positive relationship between participation in extracurricular activities and overall GPA.  These findings may assist teachers and school administrators in decision-making regarding the allocation of resources to extracurricular activities.  Further research could be conducted in larger settings, in addition to examining the impact of student, teacher and parent attitudes on extracurricular participation and academic success Background and purpose: For many years, students’ interest in the field of natural sciences has declined, which consequently results in decreasing numbers of professional staff in the mentioned field. The aim of this study was to examine the attendance of extracurricular activities in the field of natural sciences by elementary school students (age 13 and 14) in Zagreb and whether the teachers\u27 expectations are in line with the students\u27 preferences for the content offered as part of extracurricular activities in biology.
Material and methods: Using an anonymous online survey (Google Forms), data were collected on participation in extracurricular activities in the field of natural sciences and the attractiveness of the content of extracurricular activities. The respondents were 90 students in the 7th grade and 46 teachers of biology in Zagreb, 2020.
Results: Participation in extracurricular activities in the field of natural sciences among the surveyed students was very low. Students were attracted to content that includes simple practical work in the field of biology, including microscopy, but the perception of their interest by teachers is not in accordance with the real interests of the students.
Conclusion: The results of this research show that the share of the science field in extracurricular activities is low, and that the surveyed teachers are not aware of the students\u27 wishes regarding the content offered in extracurricular activities. The conducted research can be a good basis for organizing and planning extracurricular activities in elementary school Thesis (Master: Education)--Central University of TechnologyIt is well documented in literature that participation in extracurricular activities in schools has a positive influence on learners’ attendance, participation, scholastic achievements and career aspirations. On the otherhand, it is also noted that the lack or in some cases, the non-existence of extracurricular activities stifle learners’ growth and learning, especially in multicultural school settings, where the foundation for learners’ development has to occur in a conducive environment. Most multicultural primary schools in the Free State province, in particular the Letjweleputswa educational district, seem not to use extracurricular activities as an effective tool in promoting learners’ holistic development. This phenomenon initiated this study to persue it’s main aim, which is to assess teachers’ role in promoting the holistic development of learners in multicultural school settings of the Free State province, in particular, the Lejweleputswa educational district A mixed method approach was persued in realising the objectives for this study. Questionnaires were used to ascertain teachers’ perceptions regarding their role in promoting the holistic development of learners through extracurricular activities and how they use these activities in advancing learners’ physical, cognitive, social, academic, spiritual and emotional development. Learners’ views and lived experiences on the use of extracurricular activities in promoting their holistic development was ascertained via semi- structured focus group interviews. Research findings revealed that schools offer extracurricular activities to varying degrees and that some activities are non-existent at most institutions. A total of 29.23% teachers did not participate in extracurricular activities, whilst 47.69% of teachers participate at least once a week in activities. Teacher participants appear to lack knowledge, skills, commitment, willingness and enthusiasm to encourage learners to participate in extracurricular activities and as such come forth as being unsure of how extracurricular activities could possibly promote the holistic development of their learners. Learner participants stated that their involvement in extracurricular activities could give them a greater chance of being employed; of getting a better job one day; of being accepted into university; and of developing certain attributes, such as creativity, innovation, and endurance. The study recommends that multicultural schools in the Free State province, in particular the Letjweleputswa educational district need to implement various extracurricular activities as to develop a range of traits and competencies for their learners- this response of schools could possible cultivate an institutional atmosphere for the development of learners’ physical, emotional, cognitive, social, moral underpinnings, problem-solving, academic, life-skills, well-being, leadership skills, analytical skills, and communication skills Limited research had been conducted on the role extracurricular activities had on school culture. Even less was dedicated to how middle school educators perceived how extracurricular activities influenced school culture. Due to the lack of overall research, further research was necessary to develop a better understanding of the influence of extracurricular activities on school culture, more specifically the Safe Supportive Schools Model’s engagement and environment elements of school culture. The purpose of this basic interpretive qualitative study was to examine educators’ perceptions of the influence extracurricular activities had on the Safe Supportive Schools Model’s engagement and environment elements of school culture at two Title I middle schools in south Alabama. For this study, I conducted a document analysis on the extracurricular activities provided by each school, and I used an email list provided by each school’s principal to email a questionnaire. I analyzed the extracurricular activities provided and the number of students who participated in each. I then coded the questionnaire responses from 12 participants. Six themes emerged regarding educators\u27 perceptions of the influence extracurricular activities had on the Safe Supportive Schools Model’s engagement and environment elements of school culture. I formed three themes from the engagement element: student engagement, shaping school culture, and educator involvement and support. I formed three additional three themes from the environment element: student development, instructional environment, and physical health and wellness This study aimed to determine the effect of students activiness in extracurricular activities toward students achievement MAN Yogyakarta II 11th class academic year 2012/2013.

The population in this study were students of 11th class who take extracurricular activities as much 211 students and the sample was 118 students. The data of student activeness in this study were taken with a questionnaire instrument, while for the learning achievement data retrieved by using the method of documentation, namely student report cards. Validity test of the instrument using Product Moment correlation and reliability test using Cronbach Alpha. Data requirements analysis test using the normality test and linearity test, while for hypothesis testing using simple correlation.

The results of data analysis showed that the students activeness in extracurricular activities are belong to the category of very high (40%), high (30.5%), fair (22.9%), less (4.2%) and low categories ( 1.7%). As for the learning achievement of students belong to the category of very high (7.7%), high (26.2%), fair (33.9%), less (23.7%), and low categories (8, 5%). The results of hypothesis testing showed that there was a positive and significant effect between students activeness in extracurricular activities toward students achievement at a value rcount (0.761)> rtable (0.195). While the significance value (0,00) < significance level (0,05). Regression equation Y = 43.386 +0.498 X showed that the application of students activiness in extracurricular activities increased by one, then the learning achievement increased 0,498. Determinant value R2 = 0.579 which means that contributions effect of students activeness in extracurricular activities toward student achievement were at 57.9%, while 42.1% were determined by other factors Extracurricular activities are efforts made by Muhammadiyah PK Baturan Elementary School to support the talents of its students, one of which is extracurricular public speaking activities. Researchers are interested in discussing extracurricular public speaking activities because they are rarely found in elementary schools. This research uses a qualitative case study method. Extracurricular public speaking activities address various aspects of public speaking, including acting as a host, telling stories in class, and presenting in front of a camera. Although most students showed self-confidence, some students needed intensive guidance from the extracurricular teacher to be confident. The purpose of the study was to describe extracurricular public speaking activities to develop students' confidence level for the better. The result of this study is that extracurricular public speaking activities have high enthusiasm from students so that many students participate in extracurricular activities with a sense of interest in developing self-confidence through material activities provided by extracurricular teachers Includes bibliographical references Education that instills healthy habits has acquired much attention in recent years due to
concerns related to obesity and the sedentary lifestyle of the scholastic population. Extracurricular
sports activities can contribute to the creation of healthy habits and can promote active lifestyles. These
positive habits provide social benefits and are a facilitator of sustainable development. Thisstudy had
two objectives: To assess the quality and value of extracurricular sports activities offered by schools,
as well as the satisfaction of the participants and their future intentions to participate; and to assess the
relationship between these constructs, with the aim of identifying factors that encourage schoolchildren
to be active. Information was gathered from 1080 children in secondary education in Spain (n = 1080)
(65.90% boys, 13.76   1.39 years). The instruments used were the Scale of Perception of Sports
Organizations (EPOD2) and a future intentions scale. The evaluation of satisfaction, quality, and value,
as well as the intentions expressed by the young athletes to continue participating in extracurricular
sports activities were positive, with average values close to the maximum. The best-rated quality
variables were human resources. A significant association was identified between communication
and loyalty, and response capacity and sports spaces. Likewise, perceived satisfaction and value
were related to loyalty and price. In short, student perceptions establish a clear relationship between
evaluations of activities and the intention to continue practicing sports in schools ABSTRACTThis study aims to obtain a detailed description of (1) Planning extracurricular activities in character building of students (2) Organizing extracurricular activities in character building of students (3) Directing extracurricular activities in character building of students and (4) Controlling extracurricular activities in shaping the character of students at PPM Al-Hasyimiyah Tebing Tinggi.

tissue. In diseased hearts, the distribution of fibroblasts is heterogeneous,
so there can be gradients in the fibroblast density (henceforth we call this
GFD) especially from highly injured regions, like infarcted or ischemic zones,
to less-wounded regions of the tissue. Fibrotic hearts are known to be prone to
arrhythmias, so it is important to understand the effects of GFD in the
formation and sustenance of arrhythmic re- entrant waves, like spiral or scroll
waves. Therefore, we investigate the effects of GFD on the stability of spiral
and scroll waves of electrical activation in a state-of-the- art mathematical
model for cardiac tissue in which we also include fibroblasts. By introducing
GFD in controlled ways, we show that spiral and scroll waves can be unstable in
the presence of GFDs because of regions with varying spiral or scroll-wave
frequency {\omega}, induced by the GFD. We examine the effects of the resting
membrane potential of the fibroblast and the number of fibroblasts attached to
the myocytes on the stability of these waves. Finally, we show that the
presence of GFDs can lead to the formation of spiral waves at high-frequency
pacing.Comment: 20 pages, 15 figure Abelson murine leukemia virus (A-MuLV)-transformed fibroblast nonproducer cells were used to prepare A-MuLV stocks containing a number of different helper viruses. The oncogenicity of the A-MuLV stocks was tested by animal inoculation and their ability to transform normal mouse bone marrow cells was measured in vitro. All of the A-MuLV stocks transformed fibroblast cells efficiently. However, only A-MuLV stocks prepared with helper viruses that are highly oncogenic were efficient in vivo and in vitro in hematopoietic cell transformation. In addition, inefficient helpers did not establish a stable infection in lymphoid nonproducer cells. Thus, helper virus has a more central role in lymphoid cell transformation than in fibroblast cell transformation Targeting activated fibroblasts, including myofibroblast differentiation, has emerged as a key therapeutic strategy in patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF). However, there is no available therapy capable of selectively eradicating myofibroblasts or limiting their genesis. Through an integrative analysis of the regulator genes that are responsible for the activation of IPF fibroblasts, we noticed the phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2)-binding protein, myristoylated alanine-rich C-kinase substrate (MARCKS), as a potential target molecule for IPF. Herein, we have employed a 25-mer novel peptide, MARCKS phosphorylation site domain sequence (MPS), to determine if MARCKS inhibition reduces pulmonary fibrosis through the inactivation of PI3K/protein kinase B (AKT) signaling in fibroblast cells. We first observed that higher levels of MARCKS phosphorylation and the myofibroblast marker α-smooth muscle actin (α-SMA) were notably overexpressed in all tested IPF lung tissues and fibroblast cells. Treatment with the MPS peptide suppressed levels of MARCKS phosphorylation in primary IPF fibroblasts. A kinetic assay confirmed that this peptide binds to phospholipids, particularly PIP2, with a dissociation constant of 17.64 nM. As expected, a decrease of phosphatidylinositol (3,4,5)-trisphosphate pools and AKT activity occurred in MPS-treated IPF fibroblast cells. MPS peptide was demonstrated to impair cell proliferation, invasion, and migration in multiple IPF fibroblast cells in vitro as well as to reduce pulmonary fibrosis in bleomycin-treated mice in vivo. Surprisingly, we found that MPS peptide decreases α-SMA expression and synergistically interacts with nintedanib treatment in IPF fibroblasts. Our data suggest MARCKS as a druggable target in pulmonary fibrosis and also provide a promising antifibrotic agent that may lead to effective IPF treatments.-Yang, D. C., Li, J.-M., Xu, J., Oldham, J., Phan, S. H., Last, J. A., Wu, R., Chen, C.-H. Tackling MARCKS-PIP3 circuit attenuates fibroblast activation and fibrosis progression Fibroblast growth factors and their receptors play a key role in cell proliferation, migration and differentiation.

Fibroblast growth factor receptor 2 (FGFR2) is involved in carcinogenesis and its altered expression has been

shown in several tumors, such as breast, thyroid and pancreatic cancer. The two isoforms of FGFR2 gene, FGFR2-

IIIb (also known as KGFR) and FGFR2-IIIc have been shown to exert differential roles in pancreatic cancer. FGFR2-

IIIc supports pancreatic cell proliferation, while overexpression of FGFR2-IIIb is correlated to major invasion and

metastasis formation. This review focuses on the role of FGFR2 signaling in pancreatic adenocarcinoma and the

potential use of FGFR2 tissutal expression as a predictive and/or prognostic marker. Moreover, it will discuss about

the potential use of strategies for FGFR2 signaling inhibition in the treatment of pancreatic cancer BackgroundExpiratory central airway collapse is an increasingly recognized abnormality of the central airways and may be present in as many as 22% of patients evaluated for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and/or asthma. Many current treatment options require invasive procedures that have been shown to cause significant morbidity and mortality. To test the hypothesis that Teflon injection will induce sufficient fibroblast proliferation and collagen deposition, we evaluated the time course on the effect of Teflon injection in the posterior membranous trachea on the histopathology of the tracheobronchial tree.MethodsSix Yucatan Pigs were assigned to undergo general anesthesia and injection of 0.3 to 0.5 mL of sterile Teflon paste in 50% glycerin into the posterior membranous tracheal wall. A control pig received an equivalent volume of glycerin. Animals were euthanized in predefined intervals and tracheas were excised and examined under light microscopy for identifying fibroblast proliferation and collagen deposition.ResultsCompared with the control pig, the Teflon injection site showed tissue reaction of fibrohistiocytic proliferation and subsequent collagen deposition in all animals. Furthermore, the increased fibroblast proliferation and collagen deposition were time dependent (P&lt;0.01).ConclusionThis pilot study demonstrates histopathologic changes in the trachea after Teflon injection, comprised of increased fibroblast activity and collagen deposition that could be of potential use in creating greater airway rigidity in patients with sever diffuse excessive dynamic airway collapse BackgroundSkin fibrosis is a significant medical problem that leads to a functional, aesthetic, and psychosocial impact on quality-of-life. Light-emitting diode-generated 633-nm red light (LED-RL) is part of the visible light spectrum that is not known to cause DNA damage and is considered a safe, non-invasive, inexpensive, and portable potential alternative to ultraviolet phototherapy that may change the treatment paradigm of fibrotic skin disease.ObjectiveThe goal of our study was to investigate the how reactive oxygen species (ROS) free radicals generated by high fluence LED-RL inhibit the migration of skin fibroblasts, the main cell type involved in skin fibrosis. Fibroblast migration speed is increased in skin fibrosis, and we studied cellular migration speed of cultured human skin fibroblasts as a surrogate measure of high fluence LED-RL effect on fibroblast function. To ascertain the inhibitory role of LED-RL generated ROS on migration speed, we hypothesized that resveratrol, a potent antioxidant, could prevent the photoinhibitory effects of high fluence LED-RL on fibroblast migration speed.MethodsHigh fluence LED-RL generated ROS were measured by flow cytometry analysis using dihydrorhodamine (DHR). For purposes of comparison, we assessed the effects of ROS generated by hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) on fibroblast migration speed and the ability of resveratrol, a well known antioxidant, to prevent LED-RL and H2O2 generated ROS-associated changes in fibroblast migration speed. To determine whether resveratrol could prevent the high fluence LED-RL ROS-mediated photoinhibition of human skin fibroblast migration, treated cells were incubated with resveratrol at concentrations of 0.0001% and 0.001% for 24 hours, irradiated with high fluences LED-RL of 480, 640, and 800 J/cm2.ResultsHigh fluence LED-RL increases intracellular fibroblast ROS and decreases fibroblast migration speed. LED-RL at 480, 640 and 800 J/cm2 increased ROS levels to 132.8%, 151.0%, and 158.4% relative to matched controls, respectively. These LED-RL associated increases in ROS were prevented by pretreating cells with 0.0001% or 0.001% resveratrol. Next, we quantified the effect of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2)-associated ROS on fibroblast migration speed, and found that while H2O2-associated ROS significantly decreased relative fibroblast migration speed, pretreatment with 0.0001% or 0.001% resveratrol significantly prevented the decreases in migration speed. Furthermore, we found that LED-RL at 480, 640 and 800 J/cm2 decreased fibroblast migration speed to 83.0%, 74.4%, and 68.6% relative to matched controls, respectively. We hypothesized that these decreases in fibroblast migration speed were due to associated increases in ROS generation. Pretreatment with 0.0001% and 0.001% resveratrol prevented the LED-RL associated decreases in migration speed.ConclusionHigh fluence LED-RL increases ROS and is associated with decreased fibroblast migration speed. We provide mechanistic support that the decreased migration speed associated with high fluence LED-RL is mediated by ROS, by demonstrating that resveratrol prevents high fluence LED-RL associated migration speed change. These data lend support to an increasing scientific body of evidence that high fluence LED-RL has anti-fibrotic properties. We hypothesize that our findings may result in a greater understanding of the fundamental mechanisms underlying visible light interaction with skin and we anticipate clinicians and other researchers may utilize these pathways for patient benefit"	['37613613', '2254149', '78117550', '50063794', '85863696', '85861890']	[[{'name': 'Pandit, Rahul'}, {'name': 'Zimik, Soling'}], [{'name': 'Baltimore, David'}, {'name': 'Rosenberg, Naomi'}], [{'name': 'Chen, Ching-Hsien'}, {'name': 'Last, Jerold A'}, {'name': 'Li, Ji-Min'}, {'name': 'Oldham, Justin'}, {'name': 'Phan, Sem H'}, {'name': 'Wu, Reen'}, {'name': 'Xu, Jihao'}, {'name': 'Yang, David C'}], [{'name': 'Angeloni, Antonio'}, {'name': 'Ceccarelli, Simona'}, {'name': 'Vescarelli, Enrica'}], [{'name': 'Baxter'}, {'name': 'Boiselle'}, {'name': 'Bolliger'}, {'name': 'Bolot'}, {'name': 'Chertin'}, {'name': 'Chertin'}, {'name': 'Dedo'}, {'name': 'Eisner'}, {'name': 'Ernst'}, {'name': 'Ernst'}, {'name': 'Feist'}, {'name': 'Ferguson'}, {'name': 'Fujiwara'}, {'name': 'Gilkeson'}, {'name': 'Ikeda'}, {'name': 'Iwamoto'}, {'name': 'Johnson'}, {'name': 'Jokinen'}, {'name': 'Jokinen'}, {'name': 'Kirchner'}, {'name': 'Lehman'}, {'name': 'Majid'}, {'name': 'Murgu'}, {'name': 'Noppen'}, {'name': 'Nuutinen'}, {'name': 'Palombini'}, {'name': 'Susanto'}, {'name': 'Wright'}, {'name': 'Zhang'}], [{'name': 'Isseroff, R Rivkah'}, {'name': 'Jagdeo, Jared'}, {'name': 'Koo, Eugene'}, {'name': 'Mamalis, Andrew'}, {'name': 'Murphy, William'}]]	['Instability of spiral and scroll waves in the presence of a gradient in\n  the fibroblast density: the effects of fibroblast-myocyte coupling', 'The effect of helper virus on Abelson virus-induced transformation of lymphoid cells', 'Tackling MARCKS-PIP3 circuit attenuates fibroblast activation and fibrosis progression.', 'Role of Fibroblast Growth Factor Receptor 2 in Pancreatic Cancer: Potential Target for New Therapeutic Approach?', 'Teflon Injection into the Trachea Causes Predictable Fibroblastic Response and Collagen Deposition: A Pilot Study.', 'Resveratrol Prevents High Fluence Red Light-Emitting Diode Reactive Oxygen Species-Mediated Photoinhibition of Human Skin Fibroblast Migration.']	6.0	exploratory	0.5

05cbfec9-d798-43f6-b42a-21872fa8412c	hydroponics	"Greenhouse growers producing edible crops can encounter specific challenges when optimizing growing conditions. One challenge is soft growth associated with rapid tissue expansion. Soft growth can lead to plants falling over or soft, floppy leaves. These plants can suffer from increased disease pressure and lower market value. Controlling plant height is one way of reducing soft growth. Outdoors, winds or other external forces can create mechanical stress on plants, triggering a naturally occurring plant hormone called ethylene that reduces plant growth. I conducted an experiment during the summer of 2017 in the MacFarlane Greenhouses at the University of New Hampshire to introduce mechanical stress to hydroponic leafy greens, potted herbs, and seedling vegetables to test whether that stress would lead to reduced growth. I used an automated boom to brush plants with light plastic every hour and compared the growth of the brushed plants with the growth of plants that were not brushed. I found that the effects were species-dependent, with basil, sage, and tomato showing the greatest reductions in plant height. We also found that all brushed species showed a total reduction of shoot growth, and no significant difference in quality as defined by “leaf greenness. Drastic improvements in growing technology in the Netherlands have achieved a large reduction in energy use and a striking increase in production Conventional hydroponics systems generally use only chemical fertilisers, not organic ones, since there are no microbial ecosystems present in such systems to mineralise organic compounds to inorganic nutrients. Addition of organic compounds to the hydroponic solution generally has phytotoxic effects and causes poor plant growth. We developed a novel hydroponic culture method using organic fertiliser. A microbial ecosystem was constructed in hydroponic solution by regulating the amounts of organic fertiliser and soil, with moderate aeration. The microbial ecosystem mineralised organic nitrogen to nitrate-nitrogen via ammonification and nitrification. A 97.6% efficiency of nitrate-nitrogen generation from the organic nitrogen in the organic fertiliser was achieved. The culture solution containing the microbial ecosystem was usable as a hydroponic solution. Vegetable plants grew well in our organic hydroponics system under continuous addition of organic fertiliser, and the yield and quality approximated those of vegetables grown by conventional hydroponics Two selenium (Se) fertilization methods were tested for their effects on levels of anticarcinogenic selenocompounds in radish (Raphanus sativus), as well as other nutraceuticals. First, radish was grown on soil and foliar selenate applied 7d before harvest at 0, 5, 10 and 20 mg Se per plant. Selenium levels were up to 1,200 mg Se/kg DW in leaves and 120 mg Se/kg DW in roots. The thiols cysteine and glutathione were present at 2-3 fold higher levels in roots of Se treated plants, and total glucosinolate levels were 35% higher, due to increases in glucoraphanin. The only seleno-aminoacid detected in Se treated plants was Se-methyl-SeCys (100 mg/kg FW in leaves, 33 mg/kg FW in roots). The levels of phenolic aminoacids increased with selenate treatment, as did root total nitrogen and protein content, while the level of several polyphenols decreased. Second, radish was grown in hydroponics and supplied with 0, 5, 10, 20, or 40 \uf06dM selenate for one week. Selenate treatment led to a 20-30% increase in biomass.  Selenium concentration was 242 mg Se/kg DW in leaves and 85 mg Se/kg DW in roots. Cysteine levels decreased with Se in leaves but increased in roots; glutatione levels decreased in both. Total glucosinolate levels in leaves decreased with Se treatment due to repression of genes involved in glucosinolates metabolism. Se-methyl-SeCys concentration ranged from 7-15 mg/kg FW. Aminoacid concentration increased with Se treatment in leaves but decreased in roots. Roots of Se treated plants contained elevated transcript levels of sulfate transporters (Sultr) and ATP sulfurylase, a key enzyme of S/Se assimilation. No effects on polyphenols were observed. In conclusion, Se biofortification of radish roots may be achieved via foliar spray or hydroponic supply. One to ten radishes could fulfill the daily human requirement (70 \uf06dg) after a single foliar spray of 5 mg selenate per plant or one week of 5-10 \uf06dM selenate supply in hydroponics. The radishes metabolized selenate to the anticarcinogenic compound Se-methyl-selenocysteine. Selenate treatment enhanced levels of other nutraceuticals in radish roots, including glucoraphanin. Therefore, Se biofortification can produce plants with superior health benefit Zinc Oxide (ZnO) is an inorganic compound and it is doped with aluminum to increase its capabilities.

Aluminum Zinc Oxide (AZO) thin films are semiconductor materials that have band gap energy of 3.3eV. Various method

of deposition have been study to growth AZO thin films. It has been extensively use in solar cell application, display

application, gas sensing purposes, and thin film transistors (TFTs). In this work, sol gel method and spin coating was used

to deposited AZO thin films. The ZnO sol-gel were synthesized using zinc acetate dihydrate as precursor, isopropanol as

solvent, diethanolamine as sol stabilizer, and distilled water as oxidation agent. Then, synthesized ZnO were doped with

different mole ratio of aluminum nitrate nanohydrate to produced AZO. The glass substrate was used as substrate and AZO

thin films were then calcinated at 300°C and 500°C. The characterization of AZO thin film were done using X-ray

Diffraction (XRD), Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM), Ultraviolet-visible spectroscopy (UV-Vis), Field Emission

Scanning Electron Microscope (FESEM), and Energy Dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX). The XRD results show that

the ZnO with hexagonal wurtzite-type structure and temperature does have effect on the film intensity which related to

crystallinity of thin films. Through AFM analysis, the value of RMS decreases from 3.018 nm to 2.240 nm as the

percentage above 90% after wavelength 400 nm with band gap value of 3.3 eV. FESEM image show that the grain boundary

of AZO decrease with both parameter (mole ratio and calcinations temperature). Both parameters do have effect on AZO

EDX analysis shows that there are existence of zinc, oxide, and aluminum This research investigates various methods for producing food on the campus of Gettysburg College in order to improve food sustainability. The transportation of food contributes to the increased use of fossil fuels, which in turn leads to global warming and climate change. By producing a larger portion of its food on-campus, Gettysburg College could reduce the amount of food transported to the school, thereby lessening the College’s environmental impact. Urban farming techniques, hydroponics, aquaponics, and greenhouse-based agriculture are explored as viable methods for achieving this goal. Examples of the use of these techniques on college campuses are drawn from Allegheny College, Acadia University, and Cornell University, among others.

...tries to crack the Code [Excerpt] In the past coaching was nearly exclusively used for executive-level development, whereas coaching is currently approached as a more widespread intervention for various levels of employees within an organization. This application of coaching has developed over the past decade. The research on such coaching for talent management across the organization as it correlates to employee performance is fairly limited. Despite the limited research, several studies have shown that coaching to develop high potential employees (in addition to more traditional coaching aimed at executives) was successful, and yielded a return on investment. However, there are key factors that help define the best practices and added value of multi-level coaching within an organization Fifteen chemistry-transport models are used to quantify, for the first time, the export of oxidised nitrogen (NOy) to and from four regions (Europe, North America, South Asia, and East Asia), and to estimate the uncertainty in the results. Between 12 and 24% of the NOx emitted is exported from each region annually. The strongest impact of each source region on a foreign region is: Europe on East Asia, North America on Europe, South Asia on East Asia, and East Asia on North America. Europe exports the most NOy, and East Asia the least. East Asia receives the most NOy from the other regions. Between 8 and 15% of NOx emitted in each region is transported over distances larger than 1000 km, with 3–10% ultimately deposited over the foreign regions"	['40142191', '12805825', '78453834', '3154078', '469901']	[[{'name': 'Carter-Lamb, Asia A.'}], [], [{'name': 'Hill, Becky'}, {'name': 'Lu, Asia'}], [{'name': 'Kar-yiu Wong'}, {'name': 'Ming Chien Lo'}], [{'name': 'A.

2903d2ca-dfd7-41ff-b220-49f1f5e2065a	trace metals	"The waste of trace metals are led the pollutions of water, soil and air. That’s why the accurate and sensitive identification of amount of trace metals in food samples and environment are gained importance in analytical chemistry because of their toxicity to human health. Besides, the direct determination of trace metals, presented at very low concentration especially in real samples, is difficult. In this content, before determination of trace metals by instrumental methods can be achieved successfully using separation/preconcentration procedures. The different synthesized chelating polymer resin adsorbents are successfully used for the SPE of trace metals. The trace metals, such as Cu, Cr, Co, Mn, Zn and Fe, are necessary for human health, when it has been taken at certain limits. But, the trace metals, such as Hg, Cd, Pb, Ni and As are toxic metals for the human body. About this, there are studies on the determination of trace elements and mineral in food samples and environment. In this study, new methods in the synthesis of (meth)acrylamides and use as a sorbent in the trace metals extraction was identified Significant areas in Flanders, Belgium exhibit moderate contamination with trace metals caused by deposition or disposal of contaminated sediments. After disposal, the sediments develop into a soil- like material, on which vegetation is planted or develops spontaneously. Behaviour, cycling and ecosystem impacts of trace metals in calcareous dredged sediment disposal sites in Flanders was investigated. Although soil physico- chemical properties favour a low metal bioavailability, pore water concentrations can be elevated compared to pore water in uncontaminated soils. While metal leaching is not considered to be of concern, several plants accumulate elevated levels of Cd and Zn in leaves. Also metal levels in soil dwelling organisms and small mammals, particularly Cd, are elevated compared to reference situations. This raises concern for an enhanced transfer of metals to the food chain. A comprehensive knowledge of metal behaviour in these sites is essential for developing appropriate management options for these sites © 2019 Author(s). Cyanobacterial blooms are becoming more common in freshwater systems, causing ecological degradation and human health risks through exposure to cyanotoxins. The role of phosphorus and nitrogen in cyanobacterial bloom formation is well documented and these are regularly the focus of management plans. There is also strong evidence that trace metals are required for a wide range of cellular processes, however their importance as a limiting factor of cyanobacterial growth in ecological systems is unclear. Furthermore, some studies have suggested a direct link between cyanotoxin production and some trace metals. This review synthesises current knowledge on the following: (1) the biochemical role of trace metals (particularly iron, cobalt, copper, manganese, molybdenum and zinc), (2) the growth limitation of cyanobacteria by trace metals, (3) the trace metal regulation of the phytoplankton community structure and (4) the role of trace metals in cyanotoxin production. Iron dominated the literature and regularly influenced bloom formation, with 15 of 18 studies indicating limitation or colimitation of cyanobacterial growth. A range of other trace metals were found to have a demonstrated capacity to limit cyanobacterial growth, and these metals require further study. The effect of trace metals on cyanotoxin production is equivocal and highly variable. Better understanding the role of trace metals in cyanobacterial growth and bloom formation is an essential component of freshwater management and a direction for future research The thesis is devoted to a consideration of soil factors influencing the availability of trace metals for plant uptake, with particular reference to waterlogging. Chapter 1 includes a brief survey of the roles of trace metals in biological systems and the forms which exist in soil fractions. The forms of trace metals influenced by environmental factors are also discussed. The importance of waterlogging in influencing the distribution of trace metals is discussed in more detail, as are the relevant chemical changes taking place in the soil with various waterlogging times and depths. The objectives of the thesis are to investigate the effects of waterlogging on the redistribution of trace metals in soil and the implications for plant uptake. The case is made out for this study The bulk of particulate transition metals transported by Patagonian rivers shows an upper crustal composition. Riverine particulate 0.5 N HCl leachable trace metal concentrations are mainly controlled by Fe-oxides. Complexation of Fe by dissolved organic carbon (DOC) appears to be an important determinant of the phases transporting trace metals in Patagonian rivers. In contrast, aeolian trace elements have a combined crustal and anthropogenic origin. Aeolian materials have Fe, Mn, and Al contents similar to that found in regional topsoils. However, seasonal concentrations of some metals (e.g., Co, Pb, Cu, and Zn) are much higher than expected from normal crustal weathering and are likely pollutant derived.

We estimate that Patagonian sediments are supplied to the South Atlantic shelf in approximately equivalent

amounts from the atmosphere (30  106 T yr1) and coastal erosion (40  106 T yr1) with much less

coming from the rivers (2.0  106 T yr1). Low trace metal riverine fluxes are linked to the low suspended

particulate load of Patagonian rivers, inasmuch most of it is retained in pro-glacial lakes as well as in

downstream reservoirs. Based on our estimation of aeolian dust fluxes at the Patagonian coastline, the high

nutrient-low chlorophyll sub Antarctic South Atlantic could receive 1.0 to 4.0 mg m2 yr1 of leachable (0.5 N HCl) Fe. Past and present volcanic activity in the southern Andes—through the ejection of tephra—must be highlighted as another important source of Fe to the South Atlantic Ocean. Based on the 1991 Hudson volcano eruption, it appears that volcanic events can contribute several thousand-fold the mass of “leachable” Fe to the ocean as is introduced by annual Patagonian dust fallout The distribution of some heavy metals,

namely Cd, Pb, Zn, Fe, Cu, Cr and Mn in epipellic

sediments of Igbede, Ojo and Ojora rivers of Lagos

was studied weekly in the early summer (November)

of 2003. The levels of selected trace metals were determined

using Atomic Absorption Spectrophotometer

(UNICAM 969 AAS SOLAR). Trends in heavy metal

burdens in the sediments revealed weekly variations in

all the rivers assessed. Statistical analyses also showed

different mean levels of trace metals in the aquatic environments,

the distribution of which followed the sequence

Fe > Zn > Mn > Pb > Cu > Cr > Cd, Fe

> Zn > Cu > Mn > Pb > Cr > Cd and Fe > Zn >

Mn > Cu > Cr > Pb > Cd in Igbede, Ojo and Ojora

rivers respectively. Fe recorded the highest concentration

levels (1,582.95 ± 96.57 μg/g–1,910.34 ± 723.19

μg/g) in all the sediments investigated while the Cd

levels (0.06 ± 0.10 μg/g–0.47 ± 0.36 μg/g) were the

lowest. Expectedly, trace metal concentrations in fine

grain muddy sediments of the Igbede and Ojo coastline

were much higher than those of Ojora which consist

of coarse and sandy deposits covering the near shore

area. Generally, the results obtained fell within toler-able limits stipulated by World Health Organization

9ef532f7-2074-4b52-9acb-bddbc420eac3	manga	"We measured the emission lines in the spaxel spectra of MaNGA galaxies in
order to determine the abundance distributions therein. It has been suggested
that the strength of the low-ionization lines, R_2, N_2, and S_2 may be
increased (relative to Balmer lines) in (some) spaxel spectra of the MaNGA
survey due to a contribution of the radiation of the diffuse ionized gas.
Consequently, the abundances derived from the spaxel spectra through
strong-line methods may suffer from large errors. We examined this expectation
by comparing the behaviour of the line intensities and the abundances estimated
through different calibrations for slit spectra of HII regions in nearby
galaxies, for fibre spectra from the SDSS, and for spaxel spectra of the MaNGA
survey. We found that the S_2 strength is increased significantly in the fibre
and spaxel spectra. The mean enhancement changes with metallicity and can be as
large as a factor of 2. The mean distortion of R_2 and N_2 is less than a
factor of 1.3. This suggests that Kaufmann et al.'s demarcation line between
AGNs and HII regions in the BPT diagram is a useful criterion to reject spectra
with significantly distorted strengths of the N_2 and R_2 lines. We find that
the three-dimensional R calibration, which uses the N_2 and R_2 lines, produces
reliable abundances in the MaNGA galaxies. The one-dimensional N2 calibration
produces either reliable or wrong abundances depending on whether excitation
and N/O abundance ratio in the target region (spaxel) are close to or differ
from those parameters in the calibrating points located close to the
calibration relation. We then determined abundance distributions within the
optical radii in the discs of 47 MaNGA galaxies. The optical radii of the
galaxies were estimated from the surface brightness profiles constructed based
on the MaNGA observations.Comment: 19 pages, 15 figures, accepted for publication in A& The Japanese comic format known as Manga is popular all over the world. It is
traditionally produced in black and white, and colorization is time consuming
and costly. Automatic colorization methods generally rely on greyscale values,
which are not present in manga. Furthermore, due to copyright protection,
colorized manga available for training is scarce. We propose a manga
colorization method based on conditional Generative Adversarial Networks
(cGAN). Unlike previous cGAN approaches that use many hundreds or thousands of
training images, our method requires only a single colorized reference image
for training, avoiding the need of a large dataset. Colorizing manga using
cGANs can produce blurry results with artifacts, and the resolution is limited.
We therefore also propose a method of segmentation and color-correction to
mitigate these issues. The final results are sharp, clear, and in high
resolution, and stay true to the character's original color scheme.Comment: 8 pages, 13 figure This article aims to establish Algerian manga as a new object of study within the field of Francophone studies and the broader field of cartooning in the developing world. To this end, it provides a survey of existing works while answering three main questions: How has manga become part of the cultural habits of young Algerian creators and readers? What status does it hold in local cultural production? Finally, what strategies have artists employed to broaden the readership of Algerian manga and how have they taken advantage of the unique possibilities offered by this new medium Item cold-start is a classical issue in recommender systems that affects
anime and manga recommendations as well. This problem can be framed as follows:
how to predict whether a user will like a manga that received few ratings from
the community? Content-based techniques can alleviate this issue but require
extra information, that is usually expensive to gather. In this paper, we use a
deep learning technique, Illustration2Vec, to easily extract tag information
from the manga and anime posters (e.g., sword, or ponytail). We propose BALSE
(Blended Alternate Least Squares with Explanation), a new model for
collaborative filtering, that benefits from this extra information to recommend
mangas. We show, using real data from an online manga recommender system called
Mangaki, that our model improves substantially the quality of recommendations,
especially for less-known manga, and is able to provide an interpretation of
the taste of the users.Comment: 6 pages, 3 figures, 1 table, accepted at the MANPU 2017 workshop,
  co-located with ICDAR 2017 in Kyoto on November 10, 201 We conducted a Project-Based Learning (PBL)-type exercise incorporating
Japanese cartoon (manga) techniques into Requirements Development (RD)
processes. Manga has established techniques, such as those for character
setting and story development, that we thought are also valid for RD processes.
Using this manga-driven method, students were able to clarify high-level
project goals early in the development life-cycle, and succeeded in defining
high quality and unique system ideas.Comment: SEEM201 This paper outlines the historical development of the US manga (Japanese comics) industry from the 1980s through the present in order to address the question why foreign cultural products become popular in offshore markets in spite of cultural difference. This paper focuses on local publishers as “gatekeepers” in the introduction of foreign culture. Using complete data on manga titles published in the US market from 1980 to 2006 (n=1,058), this paper shows what kinds of manga have been translated, published, and distributed for over twenty years and how the competition between the two market leaders, Viz and Tokyopop, created the rapid market growth. This case analysis finds two main reasons for the growth of the manga market in the US. First is the path dependency of market growth: without Viz’s pioneering effort in the localization of manga in the 1980s, Tokyo pop’s standardization in the 2000s would not have boosted the market expansion, and vice versa. The second is stigma management by publishers. By selecting proper titles, censoring them, and establishing age rating systems, publishers sought to avoid the stigma attached to American mainstream comics and establish the legitimacy of manga as acceptable entertainment.Manga, comics, foreign influences, Japan Graphic novels, comics and manga can play an important part in encouraging reading for pleasure amongst students of any age and also have a role in teaching in many subject areas.

b674c38e-606d-44f7-ab7e-178f4b0005e6	chemistry	The energies and geometries of a series of 2-substituted-1-fluoroethanes were computed at the MP2/6-311++G**(6D)//MP2/6-31+G* level of theory for both the maxima and minima of the rotation about the C-C bond. The results did not support the predictions of a hyperconjugative model, that both 1,2-difluoroethane and 1-chloro-2-fluoroethane would strongly prefer a gauche conformation, and that 1-fluoro-2-silylethane would strongly prefer an anti conformation. The existence of competing electrostatic interactions between the fluorine and the substituents at C-2 was indicated by the detailed geometries of the gauche conformers and by the calculated sensitivity of the gauche-anti energy differences to the presence of a polar solvent. However, Fourier analyses of the torsional potential energies were wholly consistent with hyperconjugative electron donation into the C-F sigma* orbital contributing to the conformational preferences of these 1-fluoroethanes. Fourier analyses also showed that hyperconjugation contributes to the small variations in C-C and C-F bond lengths and in fluorine atomic charges that were computed. The torsional potential energies, variations in geometry and atomic charge, and sensitivity to solvent were all in accord with the expected ranking of hyperconjugative electron donating ability of bonds to carbon, C-Si \u3e C-H \u3e C-C \u3e C-Cl \u3e C-F Human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) is a rapidly evolving pathogen and causes the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) in humans. There are ~30-35 million people infected with HIV around the world, and ~25 million have died since the first reported cases in 1981. Additionally, each year 2-3 million people become newly infected and more than one million die of AIDS. An HIV-1 vaccine would help halt an AIDS pandemic, and efforts to develop a vaccine have focused on targeting the HIV-1 envelope, Env, found on the surface of the virus. A number of chronically infected individuals have been shown to produce antibodies, called broadly neutralizing antibodies (bnAbs), that target many strains of HIV-1 by binding to Env, thus suggesting promise for HIV-1 vaccine development. BnAbs to take years to develop and have a number of traits that inhibit their production; thus, a number of researchers are trying to understand the pathways that result in bnAb production so that they can be elicited more rapidly by vaccination. This review discusses results and implications from two HIV-1 infected individuals studied longitudinally who produced bnAbs against two different sites on HIV-1 Env, and immunization studies that use Envs deriving from those individuals Collisions of I-2 in the E(0(g)(+)) electronic state with CF4 molecules induce electronic energy transfer to the nearby D, beta, and D-\u27 ion-pair states. Simulations of dispersed fluorescence spectra reveal collision-induced electronic energy transfer rate constants and final vibrational state distributions within each final electronic state. In comparison with earlier reports on I-2(upsilon(E)=0-2) collisions with He or Ar atoms, we find markedly different dynamics when I-2, excited to the same rovibronic states, collides with CF4. Final vibrational state distributions agree with the associated Franck-Condon factors with the initially prepared state to a greater degree than those found with He or Ar collision partners and suggest that internal degrees of freedom in the CF4 molecule represent a substantial means for accepting the accompanying loss of I-2 vibronic energy. Comparison of the E -\u3e D transfer of I-2 excited to the J=23 and J=55 levels of the upsilon(E)=0 state reveals the onset of specific, nonstatistical dynamics as the available energy is increased above the threshold for excitation of the low frequency nu(2) bending mode of CF4. (c) 2006 American Institute of Physics published or submitted for publicatio Collisions of Br(2), prepared in the E(0(g)(+)) ion-pair (IP) electronic state, with He or Ar result in electronic energy transfer to the D, D(\u27), and beta IP states. These events have been examined in experimental and theoretical investigations. Experimentally, analysis of the wavelength resolved emission spectra reveals the distribution of population in the vibrational levels of the final electronic states and the relative efficiencies of He and Ar collisions in promoting a specific electronic energy transfer channel. Theoretically, semiempirical rare gas-Br(2) potential energy surfaces and diabatic couplings are used in quantum scattering calculations of the state-to-state rate constants for electronic energy transfer and distributions of population in the final electronic state vibrational levels. Agreement between theory and experiment is excellent. Comparison of the results with those obtained for similar processes in the IP excited I(2) molecule points to the general importance of Franck-Condon effects in determining vibrational populations, although this effect is more important for He collisions than for Ar collisions Extra virgin olive oil (EVOO) is a high-quality product that has become one of the stars in the food fraud context in recent years. EVOO can encounter different types of fraud, from adulteration with cheaper oils to mislabeling, and for this reason, the assessment of its authenticity and traceability can be challenging. There are several officially recognized analytical methods for its authentication, but they are not able to unambiguously trace the geographical and botanical origin of EVOOs. The application of nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy to EVOO is reviewed here as a reliable and rapid tool to verify different aspects of its adulteration, such as undeclared blends with cheaper oils and cultivar and geographical origin mislabeling. This technique makes it possible to use both targeted and untargeted approaches and to determine the olive oil metabolomic profile and the quantification of its constituent We report the synthesis of a gallium complex incorporating redox-active pyridyl nitroxide ligands. The (pyNO−)2GaCl complex was prepared in 85% yield via a salt metathesis route and was characterized by 1H and 13C NMR spectroscopies, X-ray diffraction, and theory. UV–Vis absorption spectroscopy and electrochemistry were used to access the optical and electrochemical properties of the complex, respectively. Our discussion focuses primarily on a comparison of the gallium complex to the corresponding aluminum derivative and shows that although the complexes are very similar, small differences in the electronic structure of the complexes can be correlated to the identity of the metal Guanine-rich DNA has the potential to fold into non-canonical G-quadruplex (G4) structures. Analysis of the genome of the social amoeba Dictyostelium discoideum indicates a low number of sequences with G4-forming potential (249–1055). Therefore, D. discoideum is a perfect model organism to investigate the relationship between the presence of G4s and their biological functions. As a first step in this investigation, we crystallized the dGGGGGAGGGGTACAGGGGTACAGGGG sequence from the putative promoter region of two divergent genes in D. discoideum. According to the crystal structure, this sequence folds into a four-quartet intramolecular antiparallel G4 with two lateral and one diagonal loops. The G-quadruplex core is further stabilized by a G-C Watson–Crick base pair and a A–T–A triad and displays high thermal stability (Tm \u3e 90°C at 100 mM KCl). Biophysical characterization of the native sequence and loop mutants suggests that the DNA adopts the same structure in solution and in crystalline form, and that loop interactions are important for the G4 stability but not for its folding. Four-tetrad G4 structures are sparse. Thus, our work advances understanding of the structural diversity of G-quadruplexes and yields coordinates for in silico drug screening programs and G4 predictive tools Strained cycloalkynes are of considerable interest to theoreticians and experimentalists, and possess much synthetic value as well. Herein, a series of cyclic alkylidenecarbenes—formally obtained by replacing the carbonyl oxygen of four-, five-, and six-membered lactams, lactones, and thiolactones with a divalent carbon—were modeled at the CCSD(T)/cc-pVTZ//B3LYP/6-311+G** and CCSD(T)/cc-pVTZ//CCSD/6-311+G** levels of theory. The singlet carbenes were found to be more stable than the triplets. The strained heterocyclic alkynes formed by ring expansion of these singlet carbenes were also modeled. Interestingly, the C≡C bonds in the five-membered heterocycles, obtained from the rearrangement of β-lactam- and β-lactone-derived alkylidenecarbenes, displayed lengths intermediate between formal double and triple bonds. Furthermore, 2-(1-azacyclobutylidene)carbene was found to be nearly isoenergetic with its ring-expanded isomer, and 1-oxacyclopent-2-yne was notably higher in energy than its precursor carbene. In all other cases, the cycloalkynes were lower in energy than the corresponding carbenes. The transition states for ring-expansion were always lower for the 1,2-carbon shifts than for 1,2-nitrogen or oxygen shifts, but higher than for the 1,2-sulfur shifts. These predictions should be verifiable using carbenes bearing appropriate isotopic labels. Computed vibrational spectra for the carbenes, and their ring-expanded isomers, are presented and could be of value to matrix isolation experiments	['37588165', '62530806', '42984834', '18870527', '42984932', '125252645', '62530804', '62530594', '62530591']	[[{'name': 'Borden, W.

They participated in a cross-sectional survey that queried their willingness to receive seven different types of MMT-based ART services. The reasons for their willingness/unwillingness to accept these services were documented. The association between service acceptability and background characteristics was examined.ResultsThe most accepted integrated services were ART-related counseling (75.6%) and referral (73.2%). Concerns regarding the provider's lack of ART expertise and confidentiality issues were common barriers for the acceptance of MMT-based ART services. A trust relationship with MMT providers was a reason for service acceptance. Service acceptability was associated with a poorer perceived health status. Conclusions/Importance: ART-related services, based on the client perspective, can be delivered at MMT clinics. However, service provider training and the protection of confidentiality must be strengthened for the effective implementation of integrated service delivery Article approval pendingWith expanding pediatric antiretroviral therapy (ART) access, children will begin to experience treatment failure and require second-line therapy. We evaluated the probability and determinants of virologic failure and switching in children in South Africa This is the post-print version of the final paper published in The Arts in Psychotherapy.

Copyright @ 2012 Elsevier B.V.This review presents available evidence regarding the benefits of art therapy and therapeutic arts interventions for stroke survivors. Whilst available evidence is very limited, it suggests that art therapy may address many of the diverse cognitive, emotional and functional needs of people disabled by stroke. Attention, spatial processing, sequencing and planning seem to improve among those who persist with art therapy. Use of the stroke-affected limb may increase. Several studies report improvements in social interaction, and emotional expression. Most published reports offer single case examples, which are idiographic and illuminating. Nonetheless, the brevity of these reports, the reliance on therapist's own accounts, and uncertainties surrounding case selection make generalization of the findings uncertain. There is a pressing need for multi-method research studies. These could use quantitative standardized scales to explore changes in stroke survivors’ physical and emotional functioning, and qualitative enquiry to gain the insights of stroke survivors concerning the art therapy process. Such research designs might help to establish a better recognized role for art therapy within multidisciplinary stroke rehabilitation programs Increased mortality among men on antiretroviral therapy (ART) has been documented but remains poorly understood. We examined the magnitude of and risk factors for gender differences in mortality on ART Tuberculosis remains an important cause of death among patients infected with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). Robust data are lacking with regard to the timing for the initiation of antiretroviral therapy (ART) in relation to the start of antituberculosis therapy Despite the enormous progress made in scaling up antiretroviral therapy (ART) in sub-Saharan Africa, many challenges remain, not least of which are the identification and management of patients who have failed first-line therapy. Less than 3% of patients are receiving second-line treatment at present, whereas 15-25% of patients have detectable viral loads 12 months or more into treatment, of whom a substantial proportion might have virological failure. We discuss the reasons why virological ART failure is likely to be under-diagnosed in the routine health system, and address the current difficulties with standard recommended second-line ART regimens. The development of new diagnostic tools for ART failure, in particular a point-of-care HIV viral-load test, combined with simple and inexpensive second-line therapy, such as boosted protease-inhibitor monotherapy, could revolutionise the management of ART failure in resource-limited settings This randomized controlled trial explored the impact of Expressive Therapies Continuum (ETC)- based art therapy interventions for older adults with dementia living in a complex care home. The trial examined the efficacy of 10 art therapy intervention sessions over 4 months, comparing results with an active control group that participated in 10 art sessions. Pre- and post-assessments, including the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE), Clock Drawing Test (CDT), and the Older People’s Quality of Life (OPQOL-Brief) questionnaires, were conducted. Results demonstrated that participants displayed similar visual expression elements, shared preferences for specific media types, and equivalent ETC-based intervention entry levels. In addition, participants in the experimental group showed significant increases in OPQOL-Brief scores. Finally, MMSE-Language scores demonstrated statistically significant increases in the experimental group and decreases in the control group. The current study aligns with previous research demonstrating that art therapy can improve cognitive functioning and enhance quality of life in older adults living with dementia. It expands on previous research by providing new insights into expressive and stylistic elements, ETC entry-level, and media preferences for engaging in artmaking	['85974748', '4520565', '7984031', '4521301', '4282233', '4292090', '148698574']	[[{'name': 'Cao, Xiaobin'}, {'name': 'Li, Li'}, {'name': 'Lin, Chunqing'}], [{'name': 'Boulle, Andrew'}, {'name': 'Davies, Mary-Ann'}, {'name': 'Egger, Matthias'}, {'name': 'Eley, Brian'}, {'name': 'Giddy, Janet'}, {'name': 'Keiser, Olivia'}, {'name': 'Moultrie, Harry'}, {'name': 'Rabie, Helena'}, {'name': 'Technau, Karl'}, {'name': 'Van Cutsem, Gilles'}, {'name': 'Wood, Robin'}], [{'name': 'Annoni'}, {'name': 'Barker'}, {'name': 'Beesley'}, {'name': 'Bury'}, {'name': 'Bäzner'}, {'name': 'Bäzner'}, {'name': 'Campbell'}, {'name': 'Carmi'}, {'name': 'Csikszentmihalyi'}, {'name': 'Dekker'}, {'name': 'Dowswell'}, {'name': 'Duncan'}, {'name': 'Ellis-Hill'}, {'name': 'Ferris'}, {'name': 'Frances Reynolds'}, {'name': 'Genser'}, {'name': 'Gonen'}, {'name': 'Hackett'}, {'name': 'Hammell'}, {'name': 'Hartman-Maeir'}, {'name': 'Hass-Cohen'}, {'name': 'Horovitz'}, {'name': 'Johnson'}, {'name': 'Jones'}, {'name': 'Jones'}, {'name': 'Kim'}, {'name': 'Leonard'}, {'name': 'Long'}, {'name': 'Malchiodi'}, {'name': 'Malchiodi'}, {'name': 'McNiff'}, {'name': 'Moon'}, {'name': 'Paolucci'}, {'name': 'Pedersen'}, {'name': 'Perruzza'}, {'name': 'Redfern'}, {'name': 'Reynolds'}, {'name': 'Sacchett'}, {'name': 'Sandburg'}, {'name': 'Schaverian'}, {'name': 'Schaverian'}, {'name': 'Sell'}, {'name': 'Silver'}, {'name': 'Silver'}, {'name': 'Slayton'}, {'name': 'Symons'}, {'name': 'Wald'}, {'name': 'Wald'}, {'name': 'Wilson'}, {'name': 'Yaretzky'}], [{'name': 'Boulle, Andrew'}, {'name': 'Cornell, Morna'}, {'name': 'Egger, Matthias'}, {'name': 'Garone, Daniela Belen'}, {'name': 'Giddy, Janet'}, {'name': 'Hoffmann, Christopher J'}, {'name': 'International Epidemiologic Databases to Evaluate AIDS Southern'}, {'name': 'Johnson, Leigh F'}, {'name': 'Lessells, Richard'}, {'name': 'Maskew, Mhairi'}, {'name': 'Myer, Landon'}, {'name': 'Prozesky, Hans'}, {'name': 'Schomaker, Michael'}, {'name': 'Wood, Robin'}], [{'name': 'Anne E.

A Vulnerability Assessment and Penetration Testing framework for web apps was designed and implemented in a new framework which also includes an Artificial Intelligence subsystem. The first subsystem (Vulnerability Assessment Subsystem) deals with scanning the web app using two tools (W4AF + Wapiti) in search of vulnerabilities in the OWASP Top 10. A report is generated which, fed to the Artificial Intelligence Subsystem, is labeled by more exploitable vulnerability to the less. This subsystem was integrated via a 2-layer CNN model. The last subsystem is the Penetration Testing Subsystem, which is responsible for executing exploits Allowing traffic to grow to a level at which there is extensive and regular congestion is economically inefficient. Although the construction of additional roads can alleviate some of the effects of congestion, the benefits may be counterbalanced unless the growth in traffic volumes can be restrained. Therefore, another alternative is by implementing Transportation Demand Management (TDM), which means people still travel but at the same time the private car USAge is reduced. This paper presents the development of an expert system for sustainable transportation (E-SUTRA) through implementation of TDM. The overall result of 69% accuracy indicates the high possibility of the E-SUTRA system to be used as an advisory tool for sustainable transportation through TDM NASA is currently considering the establishment of a Space Mission for Automation and Robotics Technologies (SMART) Program to define, develop, integrate, test, and operate a spaceborne national research facility for the validation of advanced automation and robotics technologies. Initially, the concept is envisioned to be implemented through a series of shuttle based flight experiments which will utilize telepresence technologies and real time operation concepts. However, eventually the facility will be capable of a more autonomous role and will be supported by either the shuttle or the space station. To ensure incorporation of leading edge technology in the facility, performance capability will periodically and systematically be upgraded by the solicitation of recommendations from a user advisory group. The facility will be managed by NASA, but will be available to all potential investigators. Experiments for each flight will be selected by a peer review group. Detailed definition and design is proposed to take place during FY 86, with the first SMART flight projected for FY 89 Le ‘Human-Centered Artificial Intelligence (HAI, Stanford University) annonce la publication de son rapport annuel « Artificial Intelligence Index Report 2023″ qui rassemble et visualise les tendances relatives à l’intelligence artificielle The shift to e-commerce has led to an astonishing increase in online sales for retailers. However, the number of returns made on online purchases is also increasing and have a profound impact on retailers’ operations and profit. Hence, retailers need to balance between minimizing and allowing product returns. This study examines an offline showroom versus an artificial intelligence (AI) online virtual-reality webroom and how the settings affect customers’ purchase and retailers’ return decisions. A case study is used to illustrate the AI application. Our results show that adopting artificial intelligence helps sellers to make better returns policies, maximize reselling returns, and reduce the risks of leftovers and shortages. Our findings unlock the potential of artificial intelligence applications in retail operations and should interest practitioners and researchers in online retailing, especially those concerned with online returns policies and the consumer personalized service experience We study two forms of least general generalizations in description logic, the least common subsumer (LCS) and most specific concept (MSC). While the LCS generalizes from examples that take the form of concepts, the MSC generalizes from individuals in data. Our focus is on the complexity of existence and verification, the latter meaning to decide whether a candidate concept is the LCS or MSC. We consider cases with and without a background TBox and a target signature. Our results range from coNP-complete for LCS and MSC verification in the description logic εℒ without TBoxes to undecidability of LCS and MSC verification and existence in εℒI with TBoxes. To obtain results in the presence of a TBox, we establish a close link between the problems studied in this paper and concept learning from positive and negative examples. We also give a way to regain decidability in εℒI with TBoxes and study single example MSC as a special case A report containing the National Security Commission on Artificial Intelligence (NSCAI)'s third quarterly memo and second interim report with 66 recommendations in key areas.

The final section of the article discusses Kim Stanley Robinson\u27s novel 2312 (2012) within the contemporary political context of accelerationist anticapitalism, whose advocates propose working with “the machines” rather than against them Two different definitions of the Artificial Intelligence concept have been
proposed in papers [1] and [2]. The first definition is informal. It says that
any program that is cleverer than a human being, is acknowledged as Artificial
Intelligence. The second definition is formal because it avoids reference to
the concept of human being. The readers of papers [1] and [2] might be left
with the impression that both definitions are equivalent and the definition in
[2] is simply a formal version of that in [1]. This paper will compare both
definitions of Artificial Intelligence and, hopefully, will bring a better
understanding of the concept.Comment: added four new section Artificial intelligence (AI) can be defined as the ability of a machine to learn and make decisions based on acquired information. AI’s development has incited rampant public speculation regarding the singularity theory: a futuristic phase in which intelligent machines are capable of creating increasingly intelligent systems. Its implications, combined with the close relationship between humanity and their machines, make achieving understanding both natural and artificial intelligence imperative. Researchers are continuing to discover natural processes responsible for essential human skills like decision-making, understanding language, and performing multiple processes simultaneously. Artificial intelligence attempts to simulate these functions through techniques like artificial neural networks, Markov Decision Processes, Human Language Technology, and Multi-Agent Systems, which rely upon a combination of mathematical models and hardware The SP theory of computing and cognition, described in previous publications,
is an attractive model for intelligent databases because it provides a simple
but versatile format for different kinds of knowledge, it has capabilities in
artificial intelligence, and it can also function like established database
models when that is required.
  This paper describes how the SP model can emulate other models used in
database applications and compares the SP model with those other models. The
artificial intelligence capabilities of the SP model are reviewed and its
relationship with other artificial intelligence systems is described. Also
considered are ways in which current prototypes may be translated into an

AI has raised fundamental questions about what we should do with such systems, what the systems themselves should do, what risks they involve and how we can control these. - 
          After the background to the field (1), this article introduces the main debates (2), first on ethical issues that arise with AI systems as objects, i.e. tools made and used by humans; here, the main sections are privacy (2.1), manipulation (2.2), opacity (2.3), bias (2.4), autonomy & responsibility (2.6) and the singularity (2.7). Then we look at AI systems as subjects, i.e. when ethics is for the AI systems themselves in machine ethics (2.8.) and artificial moral agency (2.9). Finally we look at future developments and the concept of AI (3). For each section within these themes, we provide a general explanation of the ethical issues, we outline existing positions and arguments, then we analyse how this plays out with current technologies and finally what policy conse-quences may be drawn Artificial intelligence (AI) is rapidly integrating into modern technology and clinical practice. Although in its nascency, AI has become a hot topic of investigation for applications in clinical practice. Multiple fields of medicine have embraced the possibility of a future with AI assisting in diagnosis and pathology applications. In the field of gastroenterology, AI has been studied as a tool to assist in risk stratification, diagnosis, and pathologic identification. Specifically, AI has become of great interest in endoscopy as a technology with substantial potential to revolutionize the practice of a modern gastroenterologist. From cancer screening to automated report generation, AI has touched upon all aspects of modern endoscopy. Here, we review landmark AI developments in endoscopy. Starting with broad definitions to develop understanding, we will summarize the current state of AI research and its potential applications. With innovation developing rapidly, this article touches upon the remarkable advances in AI-assisted endoscopy since its initial evaluation at the turn of the millennium, and the potential impact these AI models may have on the modern clinical practice. As with any discussion of new technology, its limitations must also be understood to apply clinical AI tools successfully The article discusses the problematic aspects of artificial intelligence technology application. The author's classification of artificial intelligence types is proposed, depending on their material expression (artificial intelligence unit, artificial intelligence carrier and artificial intelligence). The study allowed us to form the theoretical and legal foundations of artificial intelligence punishment system development. The authors proposed the types of artificial intelligence punishments and described their essence. To such types of punishments, they include complete deactivation (destruction) of artificial intelligence; partial deactivation of artificial intelligence; confiscation of artificial intelligence in favor of the state;the prohibition of artificial intelligence use in certain fields of activity; the implementation of gratuitous activities by artificial intelligence in the interests of the state or society; provision of a convict status (unreliable) for artificial intelligence Final report presenting the National Security Commission for Artificial Intelligence (NSCAI)'s recommendations for winning the AI era.

Artificial Intelligence course at the Faculty of Computer

Science in the Polytechnic University of Madrid,

Spain. The objective of this course is to introduce the

students to this field, to prepare them to contribute to

the evolution of the technology, and to qualify them to

solve problems in the real world using Artificial

Intelligence technology. The curriculum of the

Artificial Intelligence course, which is integrated into

the Artificial Intelligence Department's program,

allows us to educate the students in this sense using the

monographic teaching method During my stay in Salamanca (Spain), I was fortunate enough to participate in the BISITE Research Group of the University of Salamanca. The University of Salamanca is the oldest university in Spain and in 2018 it celebrates its 8th centenary.

As a computer science researcher, I participated in one of the many international projects that the research group has active, especially in big data analysis using Artificial Intelligence (AI) techniques.

AI is one of BISITE's main lines of research, along with bioinformatics and robotics.

In addition, they combine all these fields working with Internet of Things (IoT) in all its parts: sensors, communications, data analysis using Big Data techniques and visualization software with the latest technologies Abstract: With this document we will present an overview of artificial intelligence in general and artificial intelligence in the context of its use in modern computer games in particular. To this end we will firstly provide an introduction to the terminology of artificial intelligence, followed by a brief history of this field of computer science and finally we will discuss the impact which this science has had on the development of computer games. This will be further illustrated by a number of case studies, looking at how artificially intelligent behaviour has been achieved in selected games Artificial intelligence is a system with the nature of human intelligence that can automatically provide knowledge and

information to create intelligent applications to make it easier to solve problems such as problem-solving, speech recognition, and

in applying artificial intelligence in universities. The method used is a phenomenological type of qualitative method. This research

was conducted at Nurul Jadid University (UNUJA), with the subject of research being PAI lecturers and students in semester V. This

research phase was carried out by preliminary studies, observation, data collection (interviews), data verification, and drawing

conclusions. As for the results of this study, in its application, artificial intelligence in universities has a positive and negative impact

on the relationship of intelligence to learning when it is carried out outside conventional learning. The intelligence relationship

between educators and students, which includes Intelligence Quotient (IQ), Emotional Quotient (EQ), and Spiritual Quotient (SQ)

contained in it, is also a positive thing that coexists and is directed The discussed work pertains to the research of a method for tracking space debris and satellites using Artificial Intelligence Methods. By utilizing two neural networks, a smoothing of the trajectory can be achieved, and it can be predicted in such a way as to be used in radar systems. With regards to the first architecture (the one that performs smoothing on the target trajectory), it is observed that as the signal to noise ratio increases, or in other words, as the body being considered becomes larger, the performance of the network deteriorates. However, the aforementioned method can be improved with further training and is highly adaptable to different types of signal. Concerning the neural network for predictions, it is evident that it is notably able to predict future radar detection, and through filtering methods, the system is useful for potential uses of collision avoidance and radar targeting Tracking the fluctuations in blood glucose levels is important for healthy subjects and crucial diabetic patients. Tight glucose monitoring reduces the risk of hypoglycemia, which can result in a series of complications, especially in diabetic patients, such as confusion, irritability, seizure and can even be fatal in specific conditions. Hypoglycemia affects the electrophysiology of the heart. However, due to strong inter-subject heterogeneity, previous studies based on a cohort of subjects failed to deploy electrocardiogram (ECG)-based hypoglycemic detection systems reliably. The current study used personalised medicine approach and Artificial Intelligence (AI) to automatically detect nocturnal hypoglycemia using a few heartbeats of raw ECG signal recorded with non-invasive, wearable devices, in healthy individuals, monitored 24 hours for 14 consecutive days. Additionally, we present a visualisation method enabling clinicians to visualise which part of the ECG signal (e.g., T-wave, ST-interval) is significantly associated with the hypoglycemic event in each subject, overcoming the intelligibility problem of deep-learning methods. These results advance the feasibility of a real-time, non-invasive hypoglycemia alarming system using short excerpts of ECG signal General intelligence, the ability to solve arbitrary solvable problems, is
supposed by many to be artificially constructible. Narrow intelligence, the
ability to solve a given particularly difficult problem, has seen impressive
recent development. Notable examples include self-driving cars, Go engines,
image classifiers, and translators. Artificial General Intelligence (AGI)
presents dangers that narrow intelligence does not: if something smarter than
us across every domain were indifferent to our concerns, it would be an
existential threat to humanity, just as we threaten many species despite no ill
will. Even the theory of how to maintain the alignment of an AGI's goals with
our own has proven highly elusive. We present the first algorithm we are aware
of for asymptotically unambitious AGI, where ""unambitiousness"" includes not
seeking arbitrary power. Thus, we identify an exception to the Instrumental
Convergence Thesis, which is roughly that by default, an AGI would seek power,
including over us.Comment: 9 pages with 5 figures; 10 page Appendix with 2 figure Between 1946 and 1956, a number of BBC radio broadcasts were made by pioneers in the fields of computing, artificial intelligence and cybernetics. Although no sound recordings of the broadcasts survive, transcripts are held at the BBC's Written Archives Centre at Caversham in the UK. This paper is based on a study of these transcripts, which have received little attention from historians.

The paper surveys the range of computer-related broadcasts during 1946–1956 and discusses some recurring themes from the broadcasts, especially the relationship of 'artificial intelligence' to human intelligence. Additionally, it discusses the context of the broadcasts, both in relation to the BBC and to contemporary awareness of computers A quarterly report detailing recommendations for areas identified in most need of attention, ripe for action, or foundational to  AI and national security. They are grouped into seven tabs: increasing AI R&D investments, accelerating AI application in Department of Defense, strengthening AI workforce, promoting US leadership in AI hardware & 5G, improving cooperation among key allies and partners, advancing ethical and responsible AI, and threat analysis and recommended actions. The recommendation under each tab are presented in discrete memos for AI-national security dimensions Who should be charged with responsibility for an artificial intelligence

constructed an artificial intelligence using a genetic algorithm that learns in
an artificial market simulation, and investigated whether the artificial
intelligence discovers market manipulation through learning with an artificial
market simulation despite a builder of artificial intelligence has no intention
of market manipulation. As a result, the artificial intelligence discovered
market manipulation as an optimal investment strategy. This result suggests
necessity of regulation, such as obligating builders of artificial intelligence
to prevent artificial intelligence from performing market manipulation"	['120095712', '120095757', '153185046', '44684193', '24889989', '144955394', '45266892', '36289124', '154565417', '145899608', '2108451', '40415481', '157783590', '120095762', '41648658', '17038139', '44761588', '944251', '120095702', '8869516', '85462326', '98801782', '154565425', '5171979', '46895633', '4365308', '155487987', '41656191', '140532255', '9218619', '58982262', '213252', '154665164', '85872300']	"[[{'name': 'University of Maine Artificial Intelligence Initiative'}], [{'name': 'University of Maine Artificial Intelligence Initiative'}], [{'name': 'RASTRELLI, LUCA'}], [{'name': 'Ircham, I.

2eb836d3-9d8d-4eb7-ad0e-c7c4eadf8532	time management	"The study explores the relationship between people's self-report of the use of time management practices and estimates of task duration.   The hypothesis is that those who are good time managers will be good at estimating how long a future task will take (expected), how long a previously executed task has taken (retrospective) and how long a task is taking while in process (prospective).  In the expected setting results indicate that those who perceive themselves as good time managers are most accurate at estimating the duration of a future task, of those who do not perceive themselves as good time managers some grossly overestimate and many underestimate to quite a considerable extent.  The latter finding thus provides support for the 'planning fallacy' (Kahneman & Tversky,1979). In the prospective setting results indicate those who perceive themselves as good time managers tend to underestimate time passing. It is suggested that this is a motivational strategy designed to enhance a sense of control over time. Findings are discussed in relation to existing theories of time estimation Researchers function in a complex environment and carry multiple role responsibilities. This environment is prone to various distractions that can derail productivity and decrease efficiency. Effective time management allows researchers to maintain focus on their work, contributing to research productivity. Thus, improving time management skills is essential to developing and sustaining a successful program of research. This article presents time management strategies addressing behaviors surrounding time assessment, planning, and monitoring. Herein, the Western Journal of Nursing Research editorial board recommends strategies to enhance time management, including setting realistic goals, prioritizing, and optimizing planning. Involving a team, problem-solving barriers, and early management of potential distractions can facilitate maintaining focus on a research program. Continually evaluating the effectiveness of time management strategies allows researchers to identify areas of improvement and recognize progress The topic I chose for my presentation was time management. This poster reflects on my lesson and student learning throughout.https://digitalcommons.cortland.edu/corslides/1031/thumbnail.jp What is time management? The definition of time management varies across disciplines, researchers, and practitioners. In the context of workplace research, one suggested definition is “behaviours that aim at achieving an effective use of time while performing certain goal-directed activities” (Claessens et al., 2007, p. 262). Another is “a form of decision making used by individuals to structure, protect, and adapt their time to changing conditions” (Aeon & Aguinis, 2017, p. 311). Most research on time management has used self-report measures; diaries and ratings by others (e.g., supervisors) are used much less frequently. Of the self-report measures, no one measure has risen to the top, and even the most popular ones have notable differences. Though the measures often include many of the behaviors that most of us think of as time management (e.g., organizing, setting goals, prioritizing, delegating), they can also include timerelated attitudes, perceptions, and preferences. Though research has been conducted in employment settings, a lot of research has been done in academic settings, so there are many measures that pertain to study habits and other school-related conditions. Finally, many items are outdated due to advancements in technology (e.g., including references to notebooks or appointment books). A recent attempt to integrate and improve upon the three most popular measures has resulted in a promising measure that assesses four aspects of time management: 1) assessment of time (i.e., self-awareness of time use), 2) planning, 3) monitoring, and 4) sense of control (Burrus, 2019). Examples items for each factor are “When I make a things-to-do list at the beginning of the day, it is forgotten or set aside by the end of the day, “ I break complex, difficult projects down into smaller manageable tasks,” “Could you tell how many useful hours you accomplished last week?” and “I find myself procrastinating on tasks that I don\u27t like but that must be done” (Burrus, 2019). Why is time management valuable? Time management is valuable because it has a moderate and positive association with job satisfaction, job performance, and several indicators of employee stress and well-being (Aeon et al., 2021). More specifically, employees who better manage their time are likely to experience higher job satisfaction and receive higher job performance ratings than employees who are less able to manage their time well (Aeon et al., 2021). They are also more likely to October 6, 2021 have lower stress, emotional exhaustion (an aspect of burnout), and other types of psychological and physiological stress (Aeon et al., 2021). Can time management be improved? Time management tips and resources abound. Advances in technology have resulted in hundreds of software applications across many devices, to improve the efficiency of email, scheduling, tracking, organizing, note taking, prioritizing, and more. Unfortunately, research has not even begun to keep pace with practice, though there are enough studies to identify some patterns. Meta-analytic research on time management has thus far focused mostly on assessing factors that are merely associated with time management, not on causal relationships. However, there are several factors that are seen as having the potential to influence time management behaviors. These factors fall into 3 categories: individual differences, job factors, and training. For the most part, general demographics don’t matter, though women’s time management is slightly better than men’s (Aeon et al., 2021). Several aspects of personality seem to play a role, with conscientiousness (i.e., a tendency to be organized, responsible, and hardworking) having the most powerful connection to time management (Aeon et al., 2021). Contrary to the hypothesis that time management is only possible in jobs that allow for some discretion in time use, job autonomy is not related to time management, though the number of studies is so far fairly limited. The only other job factor that has been examined in this context is role overload, which is only modestly related to time management, such that greater use of time management is associated with less overload (or more overload is associated with less use of time management; Aeon et al., 2021). The more practical question is whether people can learn to manage their time better. Time management training options have been popular for many years, and dozens of courses are readily available online. Yet research on the effectiveness of these trainings is woefully limited. Thus far, the evidence shows that participating in training is modestly connected with improved time management behaviors (Aeon et al., 2021). For child welfare professionals, the ability to make effective use of limited time is critical. New staff receive training and coaching on how to best prioritize tasks, plan their day, meet required timeframes, organize files, adapt to emergencies, and communicate efficiently, among many other tasks. Use of a time management measure could help new staff develop greater self awareness about their strengths and limitations and allow trainers to evaluate the effectiveness of time management training. One other factor that has not been well researched but that may affect employees’ time management practices is organizational culture. Office or organizational norms may facilitate or hinder employees’ tendencies to make effective use of time. To explore this concept, two measures are suggested for consideration: the Time Management Environment (TiME) scale (Burt et al., 2010) and the Time-At-Work survey (Schriber & Gutek, 1987). QIC-WD Takeaways ► Time management is valuable because it has a moderate and positive association with job satisfaction, job performance, and several indicators of employee stress and wellbeing. ► Women are slightly better at time management than men. ► Several aspects of personality are associated with time management but conscientiousness is most strongly connected. ► Role overload is only modestly related to time management. ► Participating in time management training is modestly connected with improved time management behaviors. ► Use of a time management measure could help new child welfare professionals develop greater self-awareness about their strengths and limitations and allow trainers to evaluate the effectiveness of time management training. ► Practitioners or researchers who would like to assess time management should consider the recently revised measure by Burrus (2019). To explore organizational norms around time management, two measures are suggested for consideration: the Time Management Environment (TiME) scale (Burt et al., 2010) and the Time-At-Work survey (Schriber & Gutek, 1987) Class assignment: Create a poster on a sub-theme for the class (choices included finances, involvement, health and wellness, and time management Declarative process models are increasingly used since they fit better
with the nature of flexible process-aware information systems and the requirements
of the stakeholders involved. When managing business processes, in addition,
support for representing time and reasoning about it becomes crucial. Given
a declarative process model, users may choose among different ways to execute
it, i.e., there exist numerous possible enactment plans, each one presenting specific
values for the given objective functions (e.g., overall completion time). This
paper suggests a method for generating optimized enactment plans (e.g., plans
minimizing overall completion time) from declarative process models with explicit
temporal constraints. The latter covers a number of well-known workflow
time patterns. The generated plans can be used for different purposes like providing
personal schedules to users, facilitating early detection of critical situations,
or predicting execution times for process activities. The proposed approach is
applied to a range of test models of varying complexity. Although the optimization
of process execution is a highly constrained problem, results indicate that
our approach produces a satisfactory number of suitable solutions, i.e., solutions
optimal in many cases It is evident that those attending college must learn the best way to take control of their time outside of the classroom in order to maximize their overall university experience. Research on time management of homework has suggested that it has the potential to not only increase productivity and academic success, but also increase life quality due to a reduction in stress. A personal study was conducted to increase the time management of homework in an undergraduate honors student. For the purposes of this study, time management of homework was defined as the ability to complete school-related tasks according to a written and planned schedule. The behavioral treatment of self-management (goal setting, self-monitoring, and positive reinforcement) was utilized to increase the target behavior and was effective in doing so. As with previous studies conducted earlier by other researchers, this study demonstrated that control of time is beneficial for a college student’s academic and personal wellbeing"	['41260840', '84295298', '234245', '41658008', '135452680', '151501401', '67045768', '67800374', '44756559']	[[{'name': 'Gosalov, Efim'}], [{'name': 'Heaton, Timothy L.'}], [{'name': 'Francis-Smythe, Jan'}, {'name': 'Robertson Ivan'}], [{'name': 'Anderson, Cindy M.'}, {'name': 'Benefield, Lazelle E.'}, {'name': 'Chase, Jo-Ana D.'}, {'name': 'Cohen, Marlene Z.'}, {'name': 'Conn, Vicki'}, {'name': 'Fahrenwald, Nancy'}, {'name': 'Smith, Carol E.'}, {'name': 'Topp, Robert V'}, {'name': 'Zerwic, Julie'}], [{'name': 'Barba Rodríguez, Irene'}, {'name': 'Lanz, Andreas'}, {'name': 'Reichert, Manfred'}, {'name': 'Valle Sevillano, Carmelo del'}, {'name': 'Weber, Barbara'}], [{'name': 'Barnett, Ashley'}]]	['Time management', 'Time Management', 'On the Relationship Between Time Management and Time Estimation', 'Time Management Strategies for Research Productivity', 'Optimized Time Management for Declarative Workflows', 'Honorable Time Management']	9.0	exploratory	0.5

It provided the framework for local investigators carrying-out the initial study with 50 groups of working children in diverse occupations in Bangladesh, Ethiopia, The Philippines and Central America.

• The protocol was designed to inform popular assumptions about the impact of work in children's lives with evidence on children's own perception of their situation;

• The protocol is applied in ways sensitive to the local circumstances of working children, and their preferred ways of communicating their experiences;

• The protocol can be adapted to provide systematic, detailed accounts of specific occupational situations in ways that can inform context-appropriate interventions The purpose of this study was three-fold: (1) to describe anthropometric, maturation, and
somatotype differences of players based on playing positions; (2) to analyze variations of accumulated
load training (AcL) and fitness parameters between playing positions; and finally (3) to explain the
variation of maximal oxygen uptake (VO2max) and peak power (PP) through the AcL, body fat (BF),
maturity, somatotype and fitness levels. Twenty-seven male youth soccer players under-16 were
divided by the following positions participated in this study: six central midfielders, four wingers
(WG), five forwards, eight defenders, and four goalkeepers (GK). They were evaluated on two
occasions: pre-season and after-season. Height, sitting height, body mass, BF, girths, percentage of BF
(BF%), lean body mass, maturity, somatotype, sprint test, change of direction test, Yo-Yo intermittent
recovery test level 1, Wingate, PP, VO2max and fatigue index were assessed. Then, AcL was monitored
during training sessions. The main results revealed significant differences between player positions
for maturity offset (p = 0.001), for BF (p = 0.006), BF% (p = 0.015), and lean body mass kg (p = 0.003).
Also, there were significant differences for AcL and fatigue index in pre-season between player
positions (p < 0.05). In addition, there were some significant differences in pre- and after-season
for VO2max and PP between player positions (p < 0.05). In conclusion, GK showed higher values in
anthropometric, body composition variables and maturity offset compared to the other positions,
while WG presented lower levels of BF. In pre-season, there were more differences by player positions
for the different variables analyzed than after-season that reinforces the tactical role of the positions,
and the emphasis in increased load in the beginning of the season. This study could be used by
coaches, staff, and researchers as a reference for athletes of the same sex, age, and competitive level.Portuguese Foundation for Science and Technology, I.P., Grant/Award Number UIDP/

bfcc36a4-3f63-4afe-a96c-ae2e99a94bb7	swimming	"We develop a general framework for modeling the hydrodynamic self-propulsion (i.e., swimming) of bodies (e.g., microorganisms) at low Reynolds number via Stokesian Dynamics simulations. The swimming body is composed of many spherical particles constrained to form an assembly that

deforms via relative motion of its constituent particles. The resistance tensor describing the hydrodynamic interactions among the individual particles maps directly onto that for the assembly. Specifying a particular swimming gait and imposing the condition that the swimming body is force- and torque-free determine the propulsive speed. The body’s translational and rotational

velocities computed via this methodology are identical in form to that from the classical theory for the swimming of arbitrary bodies at low Reynolds number. We illustrate the generality of the method through simulations of a wide array of swimming bodies: pushers and pullers, spinners, the

Taylor=Purcell swimming toroid, Taylor’s helical swimmer, Purcell’s three-link swimmer, and an amoeba-like body undergoing large-scale deformation. An open source code is a part of the supplementary material and can be used to simulate the swimming of a body with arbitrary geometry and swimming gait It is known that swimming equipment (suit, cap and goggles) can affect the total resistance of a swimmer, and therefore impact the resulting swimming speed and race time. After the 2009 swimming world championships (WC) the international swimming federation (FINA) banned a specific type of full body suit, which resulted in an increase in race times for subsequent WC events. This study proposes that the 2009 suits provided a reduction in swimming resistance and aims to quantify this resistance reduction for male and female freestyle events. Due to the practical difficulties of testing a large sample of swimmers a simulation approach is adopted. To quantify the race time improvement that the 2009 suits provided, an equivalent 2009 “no-suit” dataset is created, incorporating the general trend of improving swimming performance over time, and compared to the actual 2009 times. A full race simulation is developed where the start, turn, underwater and surface swimming phases are captured. Independent resistance models are used for surface and underwater swimming; coupled with a leg propulsion model for underwater undulatory swimming and freestyle flutter kick, and a single element arm model to simulate freestyle arm propulsion. A validation is performed to ensure the simulation captures the change in swimming speed with changes to resistance and is found to be within 5% of reality. Race times for an equivalent “no-suit” 2009 situation are simulated and the total resistance reduced to achieve the actual 2009 race times. An average resistance reduction of 4.8% provided by the 2009 suits is identified. A factor of 0.47 ± 10%, to convert resistance changes to freestyle race time changes is determine Salps are barrel-shaped marine invertebrates that swim by jet propulsion. Morphological variations among species and life-cycle

cylindrica, Cyclosalpa sp.) and relate swimming patterns to ecological function. Using a combination of in situ dye visualization

and particle image velocimetry (PIV) measurements, we describe properties of the jet wake and swimming performance variables

including thrust, drag and propulsive efficiency. Locomotion by all species investigated was achieved via vortex ring propulsion.

The slow-swimming P. confoederata produced the highest weight-specific thrust (T =53 N kg^(–1)) and swam with the highest wholecycle

propulsive efficiency (η_wc= 55%). The fast-swimming W. cylindrica had the most streamlined body shape but produced an

intermediate weight-specific thrust (T=30 N kg^(–1)) and swam with an intermediate whole-cycle propulsive efficiency (η_wc =52%).

Weak swimming performance variables in the slow-swimming C. affinis, including the lowest weight-specific thrust (T=25 N kg^(–1))

and lowest whole-cycle propulsive efficiency (η_wc=47%), may be compensated by low energetic requirements. Swimming

performance variables are considered in the context of ecological roles and evolutionary relationships Fast-swimming hydromedusan jellyfish possess a characteristic funnel-shaped velum at the exit of their oral cavity that interacts with the pulsed jets of water ejected during swimming motions. It has been previously assumed that the velum primarily serves to augment swimming thrust by constricting the ejected flow in order to produce higher jet velocities. This paper presents high-speed video and dye-flow visualizations of free-swimming Nemopsis bachei hydromedusae, which instead indicate that the time-dependent velar kinematics observed during the swimming cycle primarily serve to optimize vortices formed by the ejected water rather than to affect the speed of the ejected flow. Optimal vortex formation is favorable in fast-swimming jellyfish because, unlike the jet funnelling mechanism, it allows for the minimization of energy costs while maximizing thrust forces. However, the vortex `formation number' corresponding to optimality in N. bachei is substantially greater than the value of 4 found in previous engineering studies of pulsed jets from rigid tubes. The increased optimal vortex formation number is attributable to the transient velar kinematics exhibited by the animals. A recently developed model for instantaneous forces generated during swimming motions is implemented to demonstrate that transient velar kinematics are required in order to achieve the measured swimming trajectories. The presence of velar structures in fast-swimming jellyfish and the occurrence of similar jet-regulating mechanisms in other jet-propelled swimmers (e.g. the funnel of squid) appear to be a primary factor contributing to success of fast-swimming jetters, despite their primitive body plans The objective of this research study is to reveal the influences of pull and push strength of arms, skin fold thickness, and body mass index towards 50-meter-crawl-style swimming achievements. The results of this research are expected to reveal the factors influencing the achievement on swimming, especially in the crawl style. This research used the survey method. The populations involved in this research were the athletes of Tirta Alvita Swimming Association under PRSI D.I. Yogyakarta (National Swimming Association Yogyakarta). The populations of this research were 8 athletes who were also the samples of this research since it used the total sample technique. The instruments used in this research were 1) pull and push strength test dynamometer to measure the arm strength in pulling and pushing, 2) skin fold thickness to measure fat thickness, 3) body mass index of ideal body weight to measure body height and weight, and 4) the achievements in 50-meter-crawl-style swimming taken from the latest swimming championship held in Tirta Kembar swimming pool, Purwokerto on 29 August 2006. The results of this research show that: 1) there were no significant influences of the pulling and pushing strength to the achievement of 50-meter- crawl-style swimming, demonstrated by the coefficient of determinant (R) 0.165; 2) there were no significant influences of skin fold thickness to the achievement of 50-meter- crawl-style swimming demonstrated by the coefficient of determinant (R) 0.085; 3) there were significant influences of body mass index to the achievement of 50-meter- crawl-style swimming demonstrated by the coefficient of determinant (R) 0.008. Key words: swimming, the pulling and pushing strength, skin fold thickness,, body mass inde Swimming is an important source of physical activity and a life skill to prevent drowning. However, little research has been conducted to understand predictors of swimming ability. The purpose of this study was to understand factors that predict swimming ability among children and adolescents in the United States (US). This was a cross-sectional survey conducted between February and April of 2017 across five geographically diverse cities. Participants were accessed through the Young Christian Men’s Association (YMCA) and included parents of children aged 4–11 years old and adolescents aged 12–17 years old. Independent t-test, analysis of variance (ANOVA), and univariate and multivariate analyses were conducted. Several factors were significant (p ≤ 0.05) predictors of swimming ability and explained 53% of the variance in swimming ability. Variables that were positively associated with swimming ability included: ability of parent(s) to swim, child/adolescent age, a best friend who enjoys swimming, water-safety knowledge, pool open all year, and encouragement to swim from parent(s). Variables that were negatively associated with swimming ability included: fear of drowning, being African American, and being female. Interventions and programs to improve the swimming ability of children and adolescents could be developed with these predictors in mind A matrix formulation is derived for the calculation of the swimming speed and
the power required for swimming of an assembly of rigid spheres immersed in a
viscous fluid of infinite extent. The spheres may have arbitrary radii and may
interact with elastic forces. The analysis is based on the Stokes mobility
matrix of the set of spheres, defined in low Reynolds number hydrodynamics. For
small amplitude swimming optimization of the swimming speed at given power
leads to an eigenvalue problem. The method allows straightforward calculation
of the swimming performance of structures modeled as assemblies of interacting
rigid spheres.Comment: 14 pages, 5 figure"	['2262063', '17395747', '2258065', '2257064', '4654661', '10709756', '17197123']	[[{'name': 'Brady, John F.'}, {'name': 'Choi, Jonathan'}, {'name': 'Dooling, Lawrence'}, {'name': 'Hoh, Nicholas'}, {'name': 'Moore, Rachel S.'}, {'name': 'Swan, James W.'}, {'name': 'Zia, Roseanna'}], [{'name': 'Forrester, A.I.J.'}, {'name': 'Hudson, D.A.'}, {'name': 'Taunton, D.J.'}, {'name': 'Turnock, S.R.'}, {'name': 'Webb, A.P.'}], [{'name': 'Madin, Laurence P.'}, {'name': 'Sutherland, Kelly R.'}], [{'name': 'Colin, Sean P.'}, {'name': 'Costello, John H.'}, {'name': 'Dabiri, John O.'}], [{'name': 'Subagyo'}, {'name': 'Susanto, Ermawan'}], [{'name': 'Irwin, Carol'}, {'name': 'Irwin, Richard'}, {'name': 'Layne, Todd'}, {'name': 'Pharr, Jennifer'}], [{'name': 'Felderhof, B.

This is the Climate Change Authority\u27s second review of the Renewable Energy Target (RET). The RET targets reductions in greenhouse gas emissions from the electricity sector and thereby contributes significantly to reducing Australia\u27s overall emissions.

In its 2012 review of the RET, the Authority found that the RET was stimulating considerable investment in renewable energy and argued that a stable and predictable policy was essential to sustain this investment. It concluded that no major changes were warranted to the overall RET design, but suggested some minor operational changes.

The uncertain future of the Authority until recently has limited the time available to conduct this review. Largely for that reason, the Authority has focused on what, it its view, are the most important issues. The Authority has also drawn on both its 2012 Authority review, and on the review conducted this year by a panel headed by Mr Dick Warburton AO LVO.

The RET and Australia\u27s emissions reduction goals 

In 2010, when the Large-scale Renewable Energy Target (LRET) was set at 41,000 GWh, it was estimated that this contribution, with contributions from the Small-scale Renewable Energy Scheme (SRES) and other pre-existing renewables (notably hydro), would together represent at least 20 per cent of Australia’s (then) projected total electricity demand in 2020. Given that electricity accounts for approximately one-third of Australia’s emissions of greenhouse gases, renewable sources were seen as making a significant contribution to Australia’s broader emissions reduction goals.

Reducing emissions in the electricity sector plays a pivotal role in climate change policies around the world. Unchecked climate change is widely seen as posing serious risks for the Australian community and its economy. Together with the broader international community, Australia has agreed to a goal of limiting global warming to no more than 2 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels to avoid the worst impacts of climate change. This requires concerted action by all countries— including Australia—to reduce their greenhouse gas emissions. The RET, as currently legislated, is a significant part of Australia’s policy response to that challenge.

The RET arrangements were envisaged to deliver ‘at least 20 per cent’ of Australia’s electricity from renewable sources by 2020 and are projected to reduce Australia\u27s emissions by 58 million tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent (Mt CO2-e) over 2015–20, and by much larger amounts in later periods.

The RET arrangements are not perfect but, in the Authority’s view, they are effective in reducing emissions (at reasonable cost) in the centrally important electricity sector. Given the absence of effective alternative measures bearing upon this sector, the Authority does not favour any significant scaling back of the 2020 LRET target of 41,000 GWh SUMMARY

The Authority is required by legislation to review the Carbon Farming Initiative (CFI) every three years; this is its first review. The review has benefited from consultations with stakeholders from a range of sectors and the Authority thanks those who contributed.

When introduced in 2011, the CFI was designed to complement the carbon pricing mechanism. Accordingly, it focused on sectors not covered by the carbon price, namely: agriculture, waste (in part), and land use, land use change and forestry. CFI projects earned credits that could be sold to entities with liabilities under the carbon pricing mechanism.

The carbon price has since been repealed, and the CFI has been expanded to form the Emissions Reduction Fund (ERF) and now covers all sectors of the economy. The ERF is the central plank of the government’s Direct Action Plan to reduce Australia’s greenhouse gas emissions. It has been introduced through amendments to the Carbon Credits (Carbon Farming Initiative) Act 2011 (Cth), which brings it within the scope of this review. For simplicity’s sake, this report refers to the CFI as the scheme as originally configured, and the ERF as the scheme as approved by the parliament in November 2014.

Under the ERF, the government will purchase emissions reductions through auctions (and possibly other means). Fixed-price contracts, typically for seven years, will be offered to those who are successful at auction. Other changes to streamline the scheme are also being introduced, and a safeguard mechanism (that will discourage large emitters from increasing their emissions above historical levels) is to commence in July 2016.

While these changes are substantial, the ERF retains an essential characteristic of the CFI in that it credits projects for reducing emissions below a defined baseline, and the baseline reflects what would have been expected to occur in the absence of the scheme.

The changes to the CFI are important for this review in two ways. First, as the scheme is being expanded to become the central element of Australia’s policy to reduce emissions and meet its targets, the lessons to be gleaned from its operation to date will be of interest in assessing the likely performance of the ERF. Second, as this review follows closely on the policy development process for the ERF, care has been taken not to duplicate that process, but to focus instead on the extent to which the design of the ERF addresses problems identified with the CFI, as well as other challenges that may arise The 2019 organizational chart for the University of Maine Climate Change Institute submitted with the institute\u27s annual report. The chart reveals names of research staff and research themes I am requesting funding for Dr. Vaughn Bryant\u27s recent visit (March 19-21) to UMaine where he met with a diversity of researchers across campus and presented two lectures on his areas of expertise. Vaughn is Professor of Anthropology and Director of the Palynology Laboratory at Texas A&M University. He is internationally known for his research in forensic pollen analysis, prehistoric diet reconstruction, honey research, and in the reconstruction of paleoenvironments. Dr. Bryant conducts extensive forensic palynological investigations for the CIA, DOE, and Customs and Border Protection (CBP). He pioneered efforts in three new and emerging areas of pollen research including: 1 ) the floral sources used by honeybees to produce honey, the use of pollen coefficient data to identify and verify premium grades of honey, and techniques used to identify the geographical origin of commercially-imported and exported honey; 2) the use of pollen data to track and help eradicate agricultural insect pests such as the boll weevil, corn earworm, root worm, and celery looper; and 3) the use of pollen as an important forensic tool used to track and convict criminals. Dr. Bryant has published numerous books, over 150 scholarly publications, and hundreds of presentations around the globe, and he was honored with the prestigious Fryxell Award for Interdisciplinary Research by the Society for American Archaeology, the premiere archaeology society. He has appeared on the Today Show, CNN, Fox Network News, the BBC, CBS News, 3-2- 1 Contact, and the Discovery Channel. His c.v. is attached Climate change impacts bring great uncertainty, raising the need to plan for the future. As the impacts of climate change are complex and far-reaching, it can be extremely difficult to foresee exactly what the consequences will be, and how they will affect different regions and sectors. However, by bringing together relevant stakeholders and brainstorming ""what if"" ideas of possible future scenarios, policy makers can prepare themselves for a variety of potential challenges. Including stakeholders from diverse backgrounds can avoid blindspots focused on a single vision of the future This report presents results from a national study of what Americans understand about how the climate system works, and the causes, impacts, and potential solutions to global warming. Among other findings, the study identifies a number of important gaps in public knowledge and common misconceptions about climate change. Educational levels: Graduate or professional, Undergraduate upper division, Undergraduate lower division, General public Knowledge of factors that trigger human response to climate change is crucial for effective climate change policy communication. Climate change has been claimed to have low salience as a risk issue because it cannot be directly experienced. Still, personal factors such as strength of belief in local effects of climate change have been shown to correlate strongly with responses to climate change and there is a growing literature on the hypothesis that personal experience of climate change (and/or its effects) explains responses to climate change. Here we provide, using survey data from 845 private forest owners operating in a wide range of bio-climatic as well as economic-social-political structures in a latitudinal gradient across Europe, the first evidence that the personal strength of belief and perception of local effects of climate change, highly significantly explain human responses to climate change. A logistic regression model was fitted to the two variables, estimating expected probabilities ranging from 0.07 (SD +/-0.01) to 0.81 (SD +/-0.03) for self-reported adaptive measures taken. Adding socio-demographic variables improved the fit, estimating expected probabilities ranging from 0.022 (SD +/-0.008) to 0.91 (SD +/-0.02). We conclude that to explain and predict adaptation to climate change, the combination of personal experience and belief must be considered This IPCC Special Report provides the latest comprehensive assessment of the ocean and cryosphere in a changing climate. It serves policymakers, decision makers, stakeholders, and all interested parties with unbiased, up-to-date, policy-relevant information. This title is also available as Open Access on Cambridge Core The paper consists of a summary of the main sources of uncertainty about climate change, and a discussion of the major implications for economic analysis and the formulation of climate policy. Uncertainty typically implies that the optimal policy is more risk-averse than otherwise, and therefore enhances the case for action to mitigate climate change Presents the Climate Change Authority\u27s recommendations on Australia\u27s future emissions reduction targets, and constitutes the first part of the Authority\u27s response to the Special Review requested by the Minister for the Environment in December 2014.

Background

This report builds on the work in the Authority\u27s recent report, Reducing Australia’s Greenhouse Gas Emissions—Targets and Progress Review , which was provided to the Minister (and released publicly) on 27 February 2014. That report, which reflected extensive public consultation, presented the Authority’s comprehensive assessment of the evidence coming from climate scientists, the efforts being made by other countries to reduce their emissions, and the targets judged to be in Australia’s best interests. The Authority recommended a target for&nbsp; 2020 and a trajectory range for emissions out to 2030. It also recommended a long-term emissions budget to guide Australia’s planning over the period to 2050.

&nbsp;


Weighing up all the relevant factors, the Authority recommended a 2020 target for Australia of 19 per cent below 2000 levels. By way of guidance for the period beyond 2020, the Authority recommended a trajectory range to 2030 of emissions reductions of between 40 and 60 per cent below 2000 levels. Under the Clean Energy Act 2011 (Cth) the Government was obliged to respond to these recommendations by the end of August 2014 but, with the repeal of that Act, this obligation lapsed.

&nbsp;

In preparing this current report, the Authority has revisited the material underpinning its February 2014 report and updated its analysis in the light of new information that has emerged since that time, particularly in regard to the science of climate change and the recent efforts of many countries to reduce their greenhouse gas emissions.

&nbsp;


The Authority believes this new information supports its previous assessment that Australia\u27s conditions for moving some way beyond its unconditional target have been met. These conditions included increased clarity around the level and credibility of international action and agreement on emissions accounting and reporting. Australia\u27s commitment under the UNFCCC includes an unconditional emissions reduction target of 5 per cent below 2000 levels by 2020, and conditional targets of up to 15 or 25 per cent.

&nbsp;


The present Government has shown no inclination to move beyond the unconditional 2020 target. The consequences of limiting Australia\u27s emissions reductions to this minimum 5 per cent target have been factored into the Authority’s consideration of appropriate post-2020 targets.

Thus, fetal growth should be monitored by ultrasound to assess for fetal overnutrition, and thereby, its clinical consequence, macrosomia. However, it is not clear which reference curve to use to define the limits of normality. Our aim is to determine which method, INTERGROWTH21st or customized curves, better identifies the nutritional status of newborns of diabetic mothers. Methods This retrospective cohort study compared the risk of malnutrition in SGA newborns and the risk of overnutrition in LGA newborns using INTERGROWTH21st and customized birth weight references in gestational diabetes. The nutritional status of newborns was assessed using the ponderal index. Additionally, to determine the ability of both methods in the identification of neonatal malnutrition and overnutrition, we calculate sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, negative predictive value and likelihood ratios. Results Two hundred thirty-one pregnant women with GDM were included in the study. The rate of SGA indentified by INTERGROWTH21st was 4.7% vs 10.7% identified by the customized curves. The rate of LGA identified by INTERGROWTH21st was 25.6% vs 13.2% identified by the customized method. Newborns identified as SGA by the customized method showed a higher risk of malnutrition than those identified as SGA by INTERGROWTH21st. (RR 4.24 vs 2.5). LGA newborns according to the customized method also showed a higher risk of overnutrition than those classified as LGA according to INTERGROWTH21st. (RR 5.26 vs 3.57). In addition, the positive predictive value of the customized method was superior to that of INTERGROWTH21st in the identification of malnutrition (32% vs 27.27%), severe malnutrition (22.73% vs 20%), overnutrition (51.61% vs 32.20%) and severe overnutrition (28.57% vs 14.89%). Conclusions In pregnant women with DMG, the ability of customized fetal growth curves to identify newborns with alterations in nutritional status appears to exceed that of INTERGROWTH21s Objective:

We investigated whether newborns respond differently to novel and deviant sounds during quiet sleep.



Methods:

Twelve healthy neonates were presented with a three-stimulus oddball paradigm, consisting of frequent standard (76%), infrequent deviant (12%), and infrequent novel stimuli (12%). The standards and deviants were counterbalanced between the newborns and consisted of 500 and 750 Hz tones with two upper harmonics. The novel stimuli contained animal, human, and mechanical sounds. All stimuli had a duration of 300 ms and the stimulus onset asynchrony was 1 s. Evoked magnetic responses during quiet sleep were recorded and averaged offline.



Results:

Two deflections peaking at 345 and 615 ms after stimulus onset were observed in the evoked responses of most of the newborns. The first deflection was larger to novel and deviant stimuli than to the standard and, furthermore, larger to novel than to deviant stimuli. The second deflection was larger to novel and deviant stimuli than to standards, but did not differ between the novels and deviants.



Conclusions:

The two deflections found in the present study reflect different mechanisms of auditory change detection and discriminative processes.



Significance:

The early brain indicators of novelty detection may be crucial in assessing the normal and abnormal cortical function in newborns. Further, studying evoked magnetic fields to complex auditory stimulation in healthy newborns is needed for studying the newborns at-risk for cognitive or language problems The Population Council, a partner of the Pakistan Initiative for Mothers and Newborns project, was responsible for undertaking operations research and a program evaluation to revisit and conduct an in-depth analysis of 1,085 verbal autopsies. The analysis had the following objectives: to identify psycho-socio-cultural issues present in the lives of the women whose verbal autopsies were reviewed, to reassess category of maternal death, and to unpack the indirect maternal deaths. The review yielded important information as to the social determinants of women’s deaths in Pakistan. The major psychological and cultural factors identified with the deaths included poverty, neglect, ignorance, disenfranchisement, and a reliance on spiritual treatment. The review also revealed that hepatic diseases were responsible for the majority of indirect maternal deaths. The information highlights the importance of psychological, social, and cultural factors in influencing women’s lives and well-being, as these factors pose an important barrier to seeking appropriate and timely care Recently, I argued that human subjects in artificial wombs (AWs) “share the same moral status as newborns” and so, deserve the same treatment and protections as newborns. This thesis rests on two claims:
          
          (A)	“Subjects of partial ectogenesis—those that develop in utero for at time before being transferred to AWs—are newborns,” and
          
          (B)	“Subjects of complete ectogenesis—those who develop in AWs entirely—share the same moral status as newborns.”
          
          In response, Elizabeth Chloe Romanis argued that the subject in an AW is “a unique human entity…rather than a fetus or a newborn.” She provides four lines of response to my essay. First, she argues that I have “misconstrued” what birth is. Once we correct that error, it becomes clear that subjects of partial ectogenesis have not been born. Second, she argues that my claims imply that non-implanted embryos (existing in vivo) “would also be ‘born.’” But that is absurd. Third, she claims I fail to “meaningfully respond” to distinctions she draws between subjects of ectogenesis and neonates. Finally, she criticizes my essay for focusing on subjects of AWs rather than focusing on pregnant persons (who should be at the “centre” of debates over AWs). I respond to each of these charges. In doing so, I reaffirm that (contra Romanis) some subjects of ectogenesis are newborns and all subjects of ectogenesis—even those that have not been born—share the same moral status as newborns Background. Newborns with hyaline membrane disease (HMD) were still able to experience death although they were given by continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP). Early diagnosis and detection of multiple factors asosiated to these incident could be used to prevent mortality in newborns with HMD were given CPAP.

Aim. To determine low birth weight (LBW), infection, premature, began CPAP> 5 hours after birth, the degree of HMD, asphyxia, not given antenatal steroids and surfactant as factors assosiated to the mortality of newborns with HMD were given CPAP.

Methods. An analytical observational study with case control design was conducted in Dr. Kariadi Hospital using medical records in January 2009 - December 2014. The group of 20 cases of newborns with HMD were given CPAP and died. The control group are newborns with HMD were given CPAP and survived as much as 20 babies. Subjects taken by consequtive sampling method. HMD was based on doctor's diagnosis and/or radiology. Bivariate analysis was done using Chi-square and Fisher Exact. Multivariate analysis was done using logistic regression.

Results. Multivariate analysis found the factors that influence the mortality of newborns with HMD by CPAP is the severity of HMD (p=0,006; OR=4,666; 95%CI=1,568-13,888). Factors other than the severity of PMH does not become an influential factor.

Conclusion. Severity factor of HMD was assosiated with mortality of newborns with HMD were given CPAP.

Keywords: HMD, CPAP, mortality risk factors This is a summary of the Pakistan Initiative for Mothers and Newborns (PAIMAN) project’s endline report. The project interventions fell into two broad areas: 1) health systems upgradation and 2) behavior change communication/community mobilization. The thrust of PAIMAN efforts were aimed at reducing the health risk to mothers and newborns by increasing knowledge of danger signs, risks and birth preparedness and, most importantly, improving antenatal and delivery practices. The report concludes that PAIMAN has had a positive impact on overall maternal and neonatal health indicators; success has been recorded in almost all areas, albeit with varying degrees of coverage and impact.

This paper fills this dual gap in the abundant research on leadership on the one hand and on networks/clusters on the other by investigating leadership in photonics clusters from a structuration perspective. Apart from giving an insight into the variety and patterns of leadership practices observed, the paper addresses the dilemma that regional innovation systems such as clusters usually have a critical need of some kind of leadership, but that neither individual nor organizational actors wish to be led. This dilemma can only be ‘managed’ by organizing for leading (in) clusters in a certain way The original, official Pacific Humanities Scholars Newsletter.https://scholarlycommons.pacific.edu/post-human/1004/thumbnail.jp BACKGROUND: 



Acute kidney injury (AKI) is a condition that leads to a rapid deterioration of renal function associated with impairment to maintain electrolyte and acid balance, and, if left untreated, ultimately irreversible kidney damage and renal necrosis. There are a number of causes that can trigger AKI, ranging from underlying conditions as well as trauma and surgery. Specifically, the global rise in surgical procedures led to a substantial increase of AKI incidence rates, which in turn impacts on mortality rates, quality of life and economic costs to the healthcare system. However, no effective therapy for AKI exists. Current approaches, such as pharmacological intervention, help in alleviating symptoms in slowing down the progression, but do not prevent or reverse AKI-induced organ damage.



METHODS: 



An in-depth understanding of the molecular machinery involved in and modulated by AKI induction and progression is necessary to specifically pharmacologically target key molecules. A major hurdle to devise a successful strategy is the multifactorial and complex nature of the disorder itself, whereby the activation of a number of seemingly independent molecular pathways in the kidney leads to apoptotic and necrotic events.



RESULTS: 



The renin-angiotensin-aldosterone-system (RAAS) axis appears to be a common element, leading to downstream events such as triggers of immune responses via the NFB pathway. Other pathways intricately linked with AKI-induction and progression are the tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF) and transforming growth factor beta (TGF) signaling cascades, as well as a number of other modulators. Surprisingly, it has been shown that the involvement of the glutamatergic axis, believed to be mainly a component of the neurological system, is also a major contributor.



CONCLUSIONS: 



Here we address the current understanding of the molecular pathways evoked in AKI, their interplay, and the potential to pharmacologically intervene in the effective prevention and/or progression of AKI HRSpec06_06.pdf: 114 downloads, before Oct. 1, 2020 According to different legal frameworks such as the European General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), an end-user's consent constitutes one of the well-known legal bases for personal data processing. However, research has indicated that the majority of end-users have difficulty in understanding what they are consenting to in the digital world. Moreover, it has been demonstrated that marginalized people are confronted with even more difficulties when dealing with their own digital privacy. In this research, we use an enactivist perspective from cognitive science to develop a basic human-centric framework for digital consenting. We argue that the action of consenting is a sociocognitive action and includes cognitive, collective, and contextual aspects. Based on the developed theoretical framework, we present our qualitative evaluation of the consent-obtaining mechanisms implemented and used by the five big tech companies, i.e. Google, Amazon, Facebook, Apple, and Microsoft (GAFAM). The evaluation shows that these companies have failed in their efforts to empower end-users by considering the human-centric aspects of the action of consenting. We use this approach to argue that their consent-obtaining mechanisms violate principles of fairness, accountability and transparency. We then suggest that our approach may raise doubts about the lawfulness of the obtained consent—particularly considering the basic requirements of lawful consent within the legal framework of the GDPR The original, official Pacific Humanities Scholars Newsletter.https://scholarlycommons.pacific.edu/post-human/1002/thumbnail.jp KEY FINDINGS

27a95dc7-89b3-4005-872d-12230808ada3	neuroimmunity	"Summary The recent definition of a network of lymphatic vessels in the meninges surrounding the brain and the spinal cord has advanced our knowledge on the functional anatomy of fluid movement within the central nervous system (CNS). Meningeal lymphatic vessels along dural sinuses and main nerves contribute to cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) drainage, integrating the cerebrovascular and periventricular routes, and forming a circuit that we here define as the CNS-lymphatic unit. The latter unit is important for parenchymal waste clearance, brain homeostasis, and the regulation of immune or inflammatory processes within the brain. Disruption of fluid drain mechanisms may promote or sustain CNS disease, conceivably applicable to epilepsy where extracellular accumulation of macromolecules and metabolic by-products occur in the interstitial and perivascular spaces. Herein we address an emerging concept and propose a theoretical framework on: (a) how a defect of brain clearance of macromolecules could favor neuronal hyperexcitability and seizures, and (b) whether meningeal lymphatic vessel dysfunction contributes to the neuroimmune cross-talk in epileptic pathophysiology. We propose possible molecular interventions targeting meningeal lymphatic dysfunctions, a potential target for immune-mediated epilepsy.Peer reviewe Mu-Opioid Receptors (MORs) are well-known for participating in analgesia, sedation, drug addiction, and other physiological functions. Although MORs have been related to neuroinflammation their biological mechanism remains unclear. It is suggested that MORs work alongside Toll-Like Receptors to enhance the release of pro-inflammatory mediators and cytokines during pathological conditions. Some cytokines, including TNF-α, IL-1β and IL-6, have been postulated to regulate MORs levels by both avoiding MOR recycling and enhancing its production. In addition, Neurokinin-1 Receptor, also affected during neuroinflammation, could be regulating MOR trafficking. Therefore, inflammation in the central nervous system seems to be associated with altered/increased MORs expression, which might regulate harmful processes, such as drug addiction and pain. Here, we provide a critical evaluation on MORs' role during neuroinflammation and its implication for these conditions. Understanding MORs' functioning, their regulation and implications on drug addiction and pain may help elucidate their potential therapeutic use against these pathological conditions and associated disorders Acetylcholine (ACh) is one the major neurotransmitters in insects, whose role in mediating synaptic interactions between neurons in the central nervous system is well characterized. It also plays largely unexplored regulatory functions in non-neuronal tissues. Here we demonstrate that ACh signaling is involved in the modulation of the innate immune response of Drosophila melanogaster. Knockdown of ACh synthesis or ACh vesicular transport in neurons reduced the activation of drosomycin (drs), a gene encoding an antimicrobial peptide, in adult flies infected with a Gram-positive bacterium. drs transcription was similarly affected in Drosophila α7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor, nAChRalpha7 (Dα7) mutants, as well as in flies expressing in the nervous system a dominant negative form (Dα7DN) of this specific receptor subunit. Interestingly, Dα7DN elicited a comparable response when it was expressed in non-neuronal tissues and even when it was specifically produced in the hemocytes. Consistently, full activation of the drs gene required Dα7 expression in these cells. Moreover, knockdown of ACh synthesis in non-neuronal cells affected drs expression. Overall, these findings uncover neural and non-neural cholinergic signals that modulate insect immune defenses and shed light on the role of hemocytes in the regulation of the humoral immune response Interferon-gamma (IFN-γ) plays a crucial role in viral infections by preventing viral replication and in the promotion of innate and adaptive immune responses. However, IFN-gamma can exert distinct effects in different persistent viral infections. The long-term overproduction of IFN-γ in retroviral infections, such as the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), human T-lymphotropic virus type 1 (HTLV-1), and human endogenous retroviruses (HERVs), resulting in inflammation, may cause neuronal damage. This review is provocative about the role of IFN-γ during persistent retroviral infections and its relationship with the causation of some neurological disorders that are important for public health The nervous system and the immune system share the common ability to exert gatekeeper roles at the interfaces between internal and external environment. Although interaction between these 2 evolutionarily highly conserved systems has been recognized for long time, the investigation into the pathophysiological mechanisms underlying their crosstalk has been tackled only in recent decades. Recent work of the past years elucidated how the autonomic nervous system controls the splenic immunity recruited by hypertensive challenges. This review will focus on the neural mechanisms regulating the immune response and the role of this neuroimmune crosstalk in hypertension. In this context, the review highlights the components of the brain-spleen axis with a focus on the neuroimmune interface established in the spleen, where neural signals shape the immune response recruited to target organs of high blood pressure Adaptive immune response is part of the dynamic changes that accompany motoneuron loss in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). CD4 &lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;  T cells that regulate a protective immunity during the neurodegenerative process have received the most attention. CD8 &lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;  T cells are also observed in the spinal cord of patients and ALS mice although their contribution to the disease still remains elusive. Here, we found that activated CD8 &lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;  T lymphocytes infiltrate the central nervous system (CNS) of a mouse model of ALS at the symptomatic stage. Selective ablation of CD8 &lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;  T cells in mice expressing the ALS-associated superoxide dismutase-1 (SOD1) &lt;sup&gt;G93A&lt;/sup&gt;  mutant decreased spinal motoneuron loss. Using motoneuron-CD8 &lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;  T cell coculture systems, we found that mutant SOD1-expressing CD8 &lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;  T lymphocytes selectively kill motoneurons. This cytotoxicity activity requires the recognition of the peptide-MHC-I complex (where MHC-I represents major histocompatibility complex class I). Measurement of interaction strength by atomic force microscopy-based single-cell force spectroscopy demonstrated a specific MHC-I-dependent interaction between motoneuron and SOD1 &lt;sup&gt;
                        G93A
                    &lt;/sup&gt;  CD8 &lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;  T cells. Activated mutant SOD1 CD8 &lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;  T cells produce interferon-γ, which elicits the expression of the MHC-I complex in motoneurons and exerts their cytotoxic function through Fas and granzyme pathways. In addition, analysis of the clonal diversity of CD8 &lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;  T cells in the periphery and CNS of ALS mice identified an antigen-restricted repertoire of their T cell receptor in the CNS. Our results suggest that self-directed immune response takes place during the course of the disease, contributing to the selective elimination of a subset of motoneurons in ALS"	['37174225', '143712243', '155843084', '132618566', '135039162', '14184690']	[[{'name': 'Abbott'}, {'name': 'Abbott'}, {'name': 'Abbott'}, {'name': 'Absinta'}, {'name': 'Al Nimer'}, {'name': 'Ali'}, {'name': 'Alitalo'}, {'name': 'Amor'}, {'name': 'Andrian'}, {'name': 'Antila'}, {'name': 'Aspelund'}, {'name': 'Bar-Klein'}, {'name': 'Barker'}, {'name': 'Bauer'}, {'name': 'Bauer'}, {'name': 'Betterman'}, {'name': 'Bhowmik'}, {'name': 'Bien'}, {'name': 'Brinker'}, {'name': 'Brouillard'}, {'name': 'Carare'}, {'name': 'Carare'}, {'name': 'Cserr'}, {'name': 'Daneman'}, {'name': 'Decker'}, {'name': 'Engel'}, {'name': 'Engelhardt'}, {'name': 'Frigerio'}, {'name': 'Galea'}, {'name': 'Gendelman'}, {'name': 'Giannoni'}, {'name': 'Granata'}, {'name': 'Guo'}, {'name': 'Haraldsen'}, {'name': 'Harling-Berg'}, {'name': 'Hawkins'}, {'name': 'Hladky'}, {'name': 'Hladky'}, {'name': 'Huggenberger'}, {'name': 'Iliff'}, {'name': 'Irani'}, {'name': 'Jones'}, {'name': 'Kandratavicius'}, {'name': 'Karaman'}, {'name': 'Kataru'}, {'name': 'Kerchner'}, {'name': 'Kesler'}, {'name': 'Kida'}, {'name': 'Kim'}, {'name': 'Klement'}, {'name': 'Kuo'}, {'name': 'Lancaster'}, {'name': 'Lei'}, {'name': 'Li'}, {'name': 'Liang'}, {'name': 'Liu'}, {'name': 'Lonser'}, {'name': 'Louveau'}, {'name': 'Louveau'}, {'name': 'Louveau'}, {'name': 'Maggio'}, {'name': 'Makinen'}, {'name': 'Marchi'}, {'name': 'Marchi'}, {'name': 'Marchi'}, {'name': 'Marchi'}, {'name': 'Marchi'}, {'name': 'Mendes'}, {'name': 'Molteni'}, {'name': 'Monti'}, {'name': 'Omalu'}, {'name': 'Omalu'}, {'name': 'Pardo'}, {'name': 'Perry'}, {'name': 'Plog'}, {'name': 'Podgrabinska'}, {'name': 'Puvenna'}, {'name': 'Rasmussen'}, {'name': 'Roberson'}, {'name': 'Robitaille'}, {'name': 'Saletti'}, {'name': 'Sarnat'}, {'name': 'Scheffer'}, {'name': 'Schwab'}, {'name': 'Sen'}, {'name': 'Shirai'}, {'name': 'Shultz'}, {'name': 'Sotiropoulos'}, {'name': 'Stamatovic'}, {'name': 'Szentistvanyi'}, {'name': 'Szuba'}, {'name': 'Tammela'}, {'name': 'Thom'}, {'name': 'Thomas'}, {'name': 'Tomkins'}, {'name': 'Tomkins'}, {'name': 'Urra'}, {'name': 'Varadkar'}, {'name': 'Vazana'}, {'name': 'Vezzani'}, {'name': 'Vincent'}, {'name': 'Visuri'}, {'name': 'Vos'}, {'name': 'Walsh'}, {'name': 'Walsh'}, {'name': 'Weller'}, {'name': 'Widner'}, {'name': 'Wilson'}, {'name': 'Zheng'}], [{'name': 'Agustín-Pavón, Carmen'}, {'name': 'Andrés-Herrera, Paula'}, {'name': 'Campos Jurado, Yolanda María'}, {'name': 'Cuitavi, Javier'}, {'name': 'Hipólito Cubedo, Lucía'}, {'name': 'Lorente, Jesús David'}, {'name': 'Polache Vengut, Ana'}, {'name': 'Torres-Perez, Jose V.'}], [{'name': 'Becchimanzi A.'}, {'name': 'Cattabriga G.'}, {'name': 'Cavaliere V.'}, {'name': 'De Leva G.'}, {'name': 'Di Lelio I.'}, {'name': 'Gargiulo G.'}, {'name': 'Gigliotti S.'}, {'name': 'Giordani G.'}, {'name': 'Pennacchio F.'}], [{'name': 'Assone, Tatiane'}, {'name': 'Casseb, Jorge'}, {'name': 'Cordeiro, Patrícia Azevedo Soares'}, {'name': 'Fonseca, Luiz Augusto Marcondes'}, {'name': 'Prates, Gabriela'}, {'name': 'Tedeschi, Marcia Regina Martinez'}], [{'name': 'Carnevale, Daniela'}], [{'name': 'Alexandre Brodovitch'}, {'name': 'Anaïs Virenque'}, {'name': 'Attila G.

The Centre for Elder Research is working with Sheridan faculty member Dr. Kirsten Madsen and Elder Abuse Prevention (ON) to better understand bullying between older adults age 55+ in Ontario. This work is funded by the Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada and aims to support the development of best practices and strategies for this diverse population. Our project aims are to collect data on the prevalence and nature of Senior to Senior bullying in Ontario, and to use this data to create a resource package outlining best practices for seniors and those working with seniors to stop bullying Research on bullying and victimization largely rests on univariate analyses and on reports from a single informant. Researchers may thus know too little about the simultaneous effects of various independent and dependent variables, and their research may be biased by shared method variance. The database for
this Dutch study was large (N = 1,065) and rich enough to allow multivariate analysis and multisource information. In addition, the effect of familial vulnerability for internalizing and externalizing disorders was studied. Gender, aggressiveness, isolation, and dislikability were most strongly related to bullying and victimization. Among the many findings that deviated from or enhanced the univariate knowledge
base were that not only victims and bully/victims but bullies as well were disliked and that parenting was unrelated to bullying and victimization once other factors were controlled. Improvements in anti-bullying strategies are likely to depend upon a greater understanding of the psychological processes at work. Transactional theories of coping may be appropriate models to use when examining how the victims of bullying cope with victimization. Research has started to examine the coping strategy aspects of such theories but has neglected the process of appraisal. The current paper aims to address this by examining the perceptions of control in the victims of bullying, and how these are influenced by such variables as gender and the severity, persistence and type of bullying experienced. A self-report questionnaire examining coping responses and perceptions of control regarding the bullying situation was administered to 348 children aged nine to 11 years. Data from the victims of bullying (N = 184) revealed that girls felt less in control of frequent bullying than infrequent bullying, a trend not evident in boys (p < 0.05). In addition, a significantly higher proportion of the male victims of bullying felt more in control than female victims (p < 0.01). Finally, victims of short-term bullying were significantly more likely to feel in control than were victims of longer-term bullying (p < 0.05).

1f37d39d-85bf-49d4-a66c-78e1c8d90537	pollutant	"Due to an increasing awareness of the potential hazardousness of air pollutants, new laws, rules and guidelines have recently been implemented globally. In this respect, numerous studies have addressed traffic-related exposure to particulate matter using stationary technology so far. By contrast, only few studies used the advanced technology of mobile exposure analysis. The Mobile Air Quality Study (MAQS) addresses the issue of air pollutant exposure by combining advanced high-granularity spatial-temporal analysis with vehicle-mounted, person-mounted and roadside sensors. The MAQS-platform will be used by international collaborators in order 1) to assess air pollutant exposure in relation to road structure, 2) to assess air pollutant exposure in relation to traffic density, 3) to assess air pollutant exposure in relation to weather conditions, 4) to compare exposure within vehicles between front and back seat (children) positions, and 5) to evaluate ""traffic zone""- exposure in relation to non-""traffic zone""-exposure. Primarily, the MAQS-platform will focus on particulate matter. With the establishment of advanced mobile analysis tools, it is planed to extend the analysis to other pollutants including including NO2, SO2, nanoparticles, and ozone Both nitrogen dioxide (NO2) and ozone (O3) are powerful oxidants in ambient air that are intimately linked through atmospheric chemistry and which continuously interchange over very short timescales. Based upon atmospheric chemistry alone, there is a strong, a priori, reason for considering O3 and NO2 together in epidemiological studies, rather than either of the two pollutants separately in single-pollutant models. This paper compares two approaches to this, using Ox, defined as O3 + NO2, as a single metric and also using O3 and NO2 together in two-pollutant models. We hypothesised that the magnitude of the association between Ox and daily mortality would be greater than for NO2 and O3 individually. Using collocated hourly measurements for O3 and NO2 in London, from 2000 to 2005, we carried out a time series analysis of daily mortality. We investigated O3, NO2 and Ox individually in single-pollutant Poisson regression models and NO2 and O3 jointly in two-pollutant models in both all-year and season-specific analyses. We observed larger associations for mean 24-h concentrations of Ox (1.30 % increase in mortality per 10 ppb) than for O3 (0.87 %) and NO2 (0 %) individually. However, when analysed jointly in two-pollutant models, associations for O3 (1.54 %) and NO2 (1.07 %) were comparable to the Ox association. Season-specific analyses broadly followed this pattern irrespective of whether the Ox concentrations were driven by O3 production (summer) or depletion (winter). This novel approach in air pollution epidemiology captures the simultaneous impact of both oxidants whilst avoiding many of the statistical issues associated with two-pollutant models and potentially simplifies health impact calculations The technology required to design and develop advanced commercial, conventional-takeoff-and-landing aircraft engines with significantly lower pollutant exhaust emissions levels than those of current-technology engines was generated and demonstrated. The target pollutant emissions reductions in tests of an advanced commercial aircraft turbofan engine were attained by developing advanced combustor designs. This technology is intended to be applicable to advanced military aircraft engines. The primary focus was on reducing the levels of the gaseous pollutant emissions System measures amount of given pollutant at specific location. Infrared laser aimed at location has wavelength that will cause molecules of pollutant to fluoresce. Detector separates fluorescence from other radiation and measures its intensity to indicate concentration of pollutant With increasing environmental sustainability awareness significant attention on ecological traffic management (eco-TM) has come into the focus of researchers and practitioners. While different approaches have been applied to reach minimal pollutant production, the classic user equilibrium calculation with the pollutant production as travel costs instead of using travel times remains in the center of attention. However, the validity of such a direct transformation to find a user equilibrium is questionable. In this paper, a simplified analytical approach to examine the above aforementioned validity has been carried out, followed by a simulation approach to verify the results of the analytical approach. The result shows that the pollutant production function violates the usual assumption of a monotonous function (typically, emission has a minimum at travel speeds around 60 km/h). It also indicates that the respective algorithms to compute the user equilibrium must deal with the fact, that the equilibrium solution is not unique and is dependent on the initial solution. This means that substantial modifications to the algorithms that compute the user equilibrium have to be discussed since they do not work as intended when pollutant production is used as travel costs, especially in a transportation system with mixed speeds that cover a range around the minimum emission speed"	['6091599', '8001165', '4472204', '4471685', '130979670']	[[{'name': 'Addicks, Johann P.'}, {'name': 'Al-Mutawakl, Khaled'}, {'name': 'Beck, Fabian'}, {'name': 'Bias, Harald'}, {'name': 'Bircks, Anna'}, {'name': 'Bock, Johanna'}, {'name': 'Börger, Julia-Annik'}, {'name': 'Dickgreber, Nicolas'}, {'name': 'Dinh, Quoc-Thai'}, {'name': 'Donat, Johannnes'}, {'name': 'Falahkohan, Sepiede'}, {'name': 'Fischer, Axel'}, {'name': 'Fischer, Tanja Christina'}, {'name': 'Friedebold, Annika'}, {'name': 'Geier, Maria Victoria'}, {'name': 'Gerber, Alexander'}, {'name': 'Golpon, Heiko'}, {'name': 'Grajewski, Sonja'}, {'name': 'Groneberg, Jan David Alexander'}, {'name': 'Groneberg, Rafael Neill B.'}, {'name': 'Götting, Michael'}, {'name': 'Henkel, Ulrich'}, {'name': 'Hoffmann, Sarah'}, {'name': 'Hupperts, Hagen'}, {'name': 'Jensen, Anna-Maria'}, {'name': 'Joachim, Ricarda'}, {'name': 'Kloft, Beatrix'}, {'name': 'Kloss, Lisa'}, {'name': 'Kreiter, Carolin'}, {'name': 'Krieger, Evelyn'}, {'name': 'Kröger, Stefan'}, {'name': 'Kusma, Bianca'}, {'name': 'Kölzow, Silvana'}, {'name': 'Kütting, Birgitta'}, {'name': 'Lauks, Mathias'}, {'name': 'Mache, Stefanie'}, {'name': 'Mark, Anke van'}, {'name': 'Mayer, Sebastian'}, {'name': 'Meyer-Falcke, Andreas'}, {'name': 'Mingomataj, Ervin C.'}, {'name': 'Mühlbach, Janette'}, {'name': 'Neye, Niko'}, {'name': 'Noga, Oliver'}, {'name': 'Pilzner, Carolin'}, {'name': 'Puk, Clemens'}, {'name': 'Quarcoo, David'}, {'name': 'Rospino, Robert'}, {'name': 'Roux, Andrés de'}, {'name': 'Sakr, Mohannad'}, {'name': 'Schilling, Ute'}, {'name': 'Schöffel, Norman'}, {'name': 'Scutaru, Cristian'}, {'name': 'Shami, Awfa'}, {'name': 'Springer, Jochen'}, {'name': 'Steinberg, Johannes'}, {'name': 'Sudik, Claudia'}, {'name': 'Szerwinski, Anne'}, {'name': 'Takemura, Masaya'}, {'name': 'Tropp, Salome'}, {'name': 'Uibel, Stefanie'}, {'name': 'Unger, Volker'}, {'name': 'Vitzthum, Karin'}, {'name': 'Wagner, Ulrich'}, {'name': 'Weiland, Marco'}, {'name': 'Welker, Pia'}, {'name': 'Westphal, Gesa'}, {'name': 'Wicker, Sabine'}, {'name': 'Witt, Christian'}, {'name': 'Zell, Hanna'}, {'name': 'Zhang, Li'}], [{'name': 'Anderson, HR'}, {'name': 'Atkinson, RW'}, {'name': 'Kelly, FJ'}, {'name': 'Williams, ML'}], [{'name': 'Bahr, D.

endemic South African sparid that comprises an important part of the handline fishery. A three-year study (1998−2000) into its reproductive biology within the Tsitsikamma National Park revealed that these fishes are

serial spawning late gonochorists. The size at 50% maturity (L50) was estimated at 292 and 297 mm FL for both females and males, respectively. A likelihood ratio test revealed that there was no significant difference between male and female L50 (P>0.5). Both monthly gonadosomatic indices

and macroscopically determined ovarian stages strongly indicate that A. argyrozona within the Tsitsikamma

National Park spawn in the astral summer between November and April. The presence of postovulatory follicles (POFs) confirmed a six-month spawning season, and monthly proportions of early (0−6 hour old) POFs showed that spawning frequency was highest (once every 1−2 days) from December to March. Although spawning season was more highly correlated to photoperiod (r = 0.859) than temperature

(r = −0.161), the daily proportion of spawning fish was strongly correlated (r= 0.93) to ambient temperature over

the range 9−22oC. These results indicate that short-term upwelling events, a strong feature in the Tsitsikamma

National Park during summer, may negatively affect carpenter fecundity. Both spawning frequency and duration

(i.e., length of spawning season) increased with fish length. As a result of the allometric relationship between

annual fecundity and fish mass a 3-kg fish was calculated to produce fivefold more eggs per kilogram of body weight

than a fish of 1 kg. In addition to producing more eggs per unit of weight each year, larger fish also produce

significantly larger eggs Indexación: Scopus.This work was supported by the FONDEF Project D06I 1024 “Development of technologies for the production of red cusk-eel fingerlings (Genypterus chilensis)”.Genypterus chilensis is a marine fish of high gastronomic demand, whose capture has declined in recent years due to overfishing. In the development of the farming technology, high mortalities were obtained during egg incubation. The objective of this study is to contribute to the knowledge of fecundity and eggs viability of G. chilensis in captivity. The spawns of G. chilensis were analyzed over a period of 2 years and 3 months. The total fecundity was estimated by counting the masses and eggs produced monthly throughout the period. The results confirm that G. chilensis is a partial spawner, since a female may more than two masses of eggs per day, due to a large amount of mass spawned per season (621 average). The total production of masses of the Farming Centre during the period was 2,290; of these, only 7% (166) corresponding to 15,330,517 eggs were incubated. Because of its high fecundity, G. chilensis produces numerous masses of eggs, of which only a small percentage reaches incubation, as well as it occurs in other marine fish. © 2018, Escuela de Ciencias del Mar.

single population were separated prior to spawning and

exposed to two different holding environments: a

‘raceway system’ and a ‘tank system’. Eggs were

stripped from females and 13 measures of egg quality

were collected, analysed individually, combined by

principle components analysis into an integrated egg

quality score which was validated against egg survival.

The multivariate egg quality score (PC1) differed for

fish held in the tank and raceway systems. Egg survival,

chorion breaking strength and chorion Se concentrations

were higher in eggs produced by broodstock held in the

tank system compared to those in the raceway system.

In contrast, chorion concentrations of P and K were

higher in eggs from fish held in the raceway system.

The results suggest that brown trout broodstock reared

in tank systems produced higher quality eggs compared

to trout reared in raceways. Finally, this study also

indicates that multivariate statistical analysis can be

used to determine egg quality from multiple egg

parameters Shear stress, generated by water movement, can kill fish eggs and larvae by causing rotation or deformation. Through the use of an experimental apparatus, a series of shear

(as dynes/cm2)-mortality equations for fixed time exposures were generated for striped bass and white perch eggs and larvae. Exposure of striped bass eggs to a shear level of 350 dynes/cm2 kills 36% of the eggs in 1 min; 69% in 2 min, and 88% in 4 min; exposure of larvae to 350 dynes/cm2 kills 9.3% in 1 min, 30.0% in 2 min, and 68.1% in 4 min. A shear level of 350 dynes/cm2 kills 38% of the white perch eggs in 1 min, 41% in 2 min, 89% in 5 min, 96% in 10 min, and 98% in 20 min. A shear level of 350 dynes/cm2 applied to white perch larvae destroys 38% of the larvae in 1 min, 52% in 2 min, and 75% in 4 min. Results are experimentally used in conjunction with the determination of shear levels in the Chesapeake and Delaware Canal and ship movement for the estimation of fish egg and larval mortalities in the field In 1988, the Oregon Department of Fish and Wildlife began sampling and monitoring the development of a new fishery for Pacific hagfish, Eptatretus stouti, and black hagfish, E. deani. Hagfish landings by Oregon trap vessels have ranged from 11,695 kg in 1988 to 340,774 kg in 1992. Whole frozen fish were shipped to South Korea for the ""eel skin"" leather market. From 1988 through 1989, I sampled 924 Pacific hagfish and 897 black hagfish from commercial and research catches. Mean length of fish sampled from commercial landings was 39.6 cmf or Pacific hagfish and 34.5 cm for black hagfish. Weight-length relationships (W=aLb) were calculated for males and females of both species. Fifty percent maturity for male and female Pacific hagfish was 35 cm and 42 cm, respectively, while 50% maturityf or male and female black hagfish was 34 cm and 38 cm, respectively. Examination of gonads for both species indicated that spawning either occurs throughout the year or the spawning period is protracted. Mature females of both species had from one to three distinct sizes of eggs, but they usually carried only one group of eggs over 5 mm in length. Mature Pacific hagfish females averaged 28 eggs over 5 mm in length, and black hagfish females averaged 14 eggs over 5 mm in length. Hermaphroditism was found in 0.2% of the Pacific hagfish examined Analysis of Amazonian freshwater fish exhibited great differences in water- and fat content. Migratory species which deposit huge amounts of eggs in a single spawning act accumulate at high water-level great amounts of fat in various parts of the body. Nonmigratory species which spawn small quantities of eggs several times per year show little or no seasonality in fat storage. Fat storage is related to the energy requirements of the species and is considered a very successful strategy by which many Amazonian fish species survive drastic environmental and related food supply changes, which are a result of the great monomodal waterlevel fluctuations of the Amazon and its big tributaries"	['4635540', '46765635', '37882262', '4630945', '4635548', '65484312']	[[{'name': 'Brouwer, Stephen L.'}, {'name': 'Griffiths, Marc.

f8a12148-7feb-41c7-a3e8-df5ca659401d	clathrin	Clathrin coat accessory proteins play key roles in transport mediated by clathrin-coated vesicles. Yeast Irc6p and the related mammalian p34 are putative clathrin accessory proteins that interact with clathrin adaptor complexes. We present evidence that Irc6p functions in clathrin-mediated traffic between the trans-Golgi network and endosomes, linking clathrin adaptor complex AP-1 and the Rab GTPase Ypt31p. The crystal structure of the Irc6p N-terminal domain revealed a G-protein fold most related to small G proteins of the Rab and Arf families. However, Irc6p lacks G-protein signature motifs and high-affinity GTP binding. Also, mutant Irc6p lacking candidate GTP-binding residues retained function. Mammalian p34 rescued growth defects in irc6 cells, indicating functional conservation, and modeling predicted a similar N-terminal fold in p34. Irc6p and p34 also contain functionally conserved C-terminal regions. Irc6p/p34-related proteins with the same two-part architecture are encoded in genomes of species as diverse as plants and humans. Together these results define Irc6p/p34 as a novel type of conserved clathrin accessory protein and founding members of a new G protein-like family Apicomplexan parasites are single eukaryotic cells with a highly polarised secretory system that contains unique secretory organelles (micronemes and rhoptries) that are required for host cell invasion. In contrast, the role of the endosomal system is poorly understood in these parasites. With many typical endocytic factors missing, we speculated that endocytosis depends exclusively on a clathrin-mediated mechanism. Intriguingly, in Toxoplasma gondii we were only able to observe the endogenous clathrin heavy chain 1 (CHC1) at the Golgi, but not at the parasite surface. For the functional characterisation of Toxoplasma gondii CHC1 we generated parasite mutants conditionally expressing the dominant negative clathrin Hub fragment and demonstrate that CHC1 is essential for vesicle formation at the trans-Golgi network. Consequently, the functional ablation of CHC1 results in Golgi aberrations, a block in the biogenesis of the unique secretory microneme and rhoptry organelles, and of the pellicle. However, we found no morphological evidence for clathrin mediating endocytosis in these parasites and speculate that they remodelled their vesicular trafficking system to adapt to an intracellular lifestyle Clathrin coats drive transport vesicle formation from the plasma membrane and in pathways between the trans-Golgi network (TGN) and endosomes. Clathrin adaptors play central roles orchestrating assembly of clathrin coats. The yeast clathrin adaptor-interacting protein Irc6 is an orthologue of human p34, which is mutated in the inherited skin disorder punctate palmoplantar keratoderma type I. Irc6 and p34 bind to clathrin adaptor complexes AP-1 and AP-2 and are members of a conserved family characterized by a two-domain architecture. Irc6 is required for AP-1-dependent transport between the TGN and endosomes in yeast. Here we present evidence that the C-terminal two amino acids of Irc6 are required for AP-1 binding and transport function. Additionally, like the C-terminal domain, the N-terminal domain when overexpressed partially restores AP-1-mediated transport in cells lacking full-length Irc6. These findings support a functional role for Irc6 binding to AP-1. Negative genetic interactions with irc6∆ are enriched for genes related to membrane traffic and nuclear processes, consistent with diverse cellular roles for Irc6 Clathrin-mediated endocytosis (CME) is a cellular trafficking process in which cargoes and lipids are internalized from the plasma membrane into vesicles coated with clathrin and adaptor proteins. CME is essential for many developmental and physiological processes in plants, but its underlying mechanism is not well characterized compared with that in yeast and animal systems. Here, we searched for new factors involved in CME in Arabidopsis thaliana by performing tandem affinity purification of proteins that interact with clathrin light chain, a principal component of the clathrin coat. Among the confirmed interactors, we found two putative homologs of the clathrin-coat uncoating factor auxilin previously described in non-plant systems. Overexpression of AUXILIN-LIKE1 and AUXILIN-LIKE2 in Arabidopsis caused an arrest of seedling growth and development. This was concomitant with inhibited endocytosis due to blocking of clathrin recruitment after the initial step of adaptor protein binding to the plasma membrane. By contrast, auxilin-like1/2 loss-of-function lines did not present endocytosis-related developmental or cellular phenotypes under normal growth conditions. This work contributes to the ongoing characterization of the endocytotic machinery in plants and provides a robust tool for conditionally and specifically interfering with CME in Arabidopsis The current model for vesicular traffic to and from the plasma membrane is accepted but the molecular requirements for this coordination are not well defined. We have identified the has1 mutant, which has a stomatal function defect, as a clathrin heavy chain 1 (CHC1) mutant allele and show that it has a decreased rate of endocytosis and growth defects that are shared with other chc1 mutant alleles. We used chc1 alleles and the related chc2 mutant as tools to investigate the effects clathrin defects have on secretion pathways and plant growth. We show that secretion and endocytosis at the plasma membrane is sensitive to CHC1 and CHC2 function in seedling roots, and that chc mutants have physiological defects in stomatal function and plant growth that have not been previously described. These findings suggest that clathrin supports specific functions of multiple cell types. Stomata movement and gas exchange is altered in chc mutants, indicating clathrin is important for stomatal regulation. The aberrant function of chc mutant stomata is consistent with the growth phenotypes observed under different water and light conditions, which are also similar to those of the secretory SNARE mutant, syp121. The syp121 and chc mutants have impaired endo- and exocytosis compared to wild type, indicating a link between SYP121-dependent secretion and clathrin-dependent endocytosis at the plasma membrane. Our findings provide evidence that clathrin and SYP121 functions are important for the coordination of endo- and exocytosis, and have an impact on stomatal function, gas exchange, and vegetative growth in Arabidopsis	['85867703', '7132072', '85867789', '51490810', '44741436']	[[{'name': 'Cascio, Duilio'}, {'name': 'Costaguta, Giancarlo'}, {'name': 'Daboussi, Lydia'}, {'name': 'Gorynia, Sabine'}, {'name': 'Lorenz, Todd C'}, {'name': 'Payne, Gregory S'}], [{'name': 'A Achbarou'}, {'name': 'A Herm-Götz'}, {'name': 'A Sadak'}, {'name': 'AE Radulescu'}, {'name': 'AL Schwartz'}, {'name': 'B Lige'}, {'name': 'B Striepen'}, {'name': 'BF Kafsack'}, {'name': 'BJ Nichols'}, {'name': 'C Agop-Nersesian'}, {'name': 'C Agop-Nersesian'}, {'name': 'C Wang'}, {'name': 'D Van Damme'}, {'name': 'David J.

Glutathione is synthesized in vivo but has been used as a bodily supplement by medical personnel to aid in preventative medicine. Known for its antioxidant properties, glutathione has been used for its anti-melanogenic effects. Intravenous glutathione requires more investigation to determine its safety for usage. It continues to be distributed to the cosmetic industry despite antagonism from the Philippine FDA. This study will research the potential effects of intravenous glutathione on women and it will propose the biochemical mechanisms of glutathione in induced disease states in women. The aim is to educate people about safer methods for skin lightening Abnormal pigmentation of Senegalese sole has been described as one problem facing the full exploitation of its commercial production. To improve our understanding of flatfish pigmentation of this commercially important species we have evaluated eleven genes related to two different processes of pigmentation: melanophore differentiation, and melanin production. The temporal distribution of gene expression peaks corresponds well with changes in pigmentation patterns and the intensity of skin melanization. Several gene ratios were also examined to put in perspective possible genetic markers for the different stages of normal pigmentation development. Further, the phenotypic changes that occur during morphogenesis correspond well with the main transitions in gene expression that occur. Given the dramatic phenotypic alterations which flatfish undergo, including the asymmetric coloration that occurs between the ocular and the blind side, and the synchrony of the two processes of morphogenesis and pigmentation ontogenesis, these species constitute an interesting model for the study of pigmentation. In this study we present a first approximation towards explaining the genetic mechanisms for regulating pigmentation ontogeny in Senegalese sole, Solea senegalensis.Ministry of Science and Innovation (MICIIN) of the Spanish Government [AGL2008-03897-C04-01/ACU]; European Community [FP7/2007-2013-222719-LIFECYCLE]; Spanish Governmentinfo:eu-repo/semantics/publishedVersio Instances of recent and rapid speciation are suitable for associating phenotypes with their causal genotypes, especially if gene flow homogenizes areas of the genome that are not under divergent selection. We study a rapid radiation of nine sympatric bird species known as capuchino seedeaters, which are differentiated in sexually selected characters of male plumage and song. We sequenced the genomes of a phenotypically diverse set of species to search for differentiated genomic regions. Capuchinos show differences in a small proportion of their genomes, yet selection has acted independently on the same targets in different members of this radiation. Many divergent regions contain genes involved in the melanogenesis pathway, with the strongest signal originating from putative regulatory regions. Selection has acted on these same genomic regions in different lineages, likely shaping the evolution of cis-regulatory elements, which control how more conserved genes are expressed and thereby generate diversity in classically sexually selected traits.Fil: Campagna, Leonardo.

Cornell University; Estados Unido Purpose: To investigate the inhibitory effect of the methanol fraction of Dioscorea nipponica Makino ethanol extract (DNM) on melanogenesis both in vitro and in vivo.Methods: Cultured mouse B16 melanoma cell and zebra fish were used to evaluate the melanogenesis inhibitory activity of DNM in vitro and in vivo, respectively. In B16 cells, inhibitory effects on intracellular melanogenesis, tyrosinase activity and reactive oxygen species (ROS) were determined after DNM treatment. In zebra fish, both toxic and antimelanogenic  ctivities of DNM on developed larvae were evaluated.Results: In B16 cells, the results show that DNM dose-dependently inhibited melanogenesis at non-toxic concentrations. Surprisingly, however, DNM had no effect on intracellular tyrosinase activity or the amount of the enzyme in B16 cells. On the other hand, DNM showed strong antioxidant activities against cell-free 2,2-diphenyl-1-picryl-hydrazl (DPPH) and 2,2’-azino-bis (3-etnylbenzthiazoline-6-sulphaonic acid) (ABTS+) free radical and intracellular ROS in B16 cells. In zebra fish, DNM significantly and dose-dependently inhibited skin melanogenesis of zebra fish larvae at non-toxic concentrations.Conclusion: The findings demonstrate that DNM inhibits melanogenesis in vitro in B16 melanoma cells and in vivo in zebrafish. Furthermore, DNM exhibits potent inhibition of melanogenesis probably as a result of its antioxidant activity in the cells.Keywords: Dioscorea nipponica, Makino, Melanogenesis, Tyrosinase, Antioxidant, Melanoma, Zebra fis PurposeOcular Albinism type 1 (OA1) is a disease caused by mutations in the OA1 gene and characterized by the presence of macromelanosomes in the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) as well as abnormal crossing of the optic axons at the optic chiasm. We showed in our previous studies in mice that Oa1 activates specifically Gαi3 in its signaling pathway and thus, hypothesized that a constitutively active Gαi3 in the RPE of Oa1-/- mice might keep on the Oa1 signaling cascade and prevent the formation of macromelanosomes. To test this hypothesis, we have generated transgenic mice that carry the constitutively active Gαi3 (Q204L) protein in the RPE of Oa1-/- mice and are now reporting the effects that the transgene produced on the Oa1-/- RPE phenotype.MethodsTransgenic mice carrying RPE-specific expression of the constitutively active Gαi3 (Q204L) were generated by injecting fertilized eggs of Oa1-/- females with a lentivirus containing the Gαi3 (Q204L) cDNA. PCR, Southern blots, Western blots and confocal microscopy were used to confirm the presence of the transgene in the RPE of positive transgenic mice. Morphometrical analyses were performed using electron microscopy to compare the size and number of melanosomes per RPE area in putative Oa1-/-, Gαi3 (Q204L) transgenic mice with those of wild-type NCrl and Oa1-/- mice.ResultsWe found a correlation between the presence of the constitutively active Gαi3 (Q204L) transgene and the rescue of the normal phenotype of RPE melanosomes in Oa1-/-, Gαi3 (Q204L) mice. These mice have higher density of melanosomes per RPE area and a larger number of small melanosomes than Oa1-/- mice, and their RPE phenotype is similar to that of wild-type mice.ConclusionsOur results show that a constitutively active Gαi3 protein can by-pass the lack of Oa1 protein in Oa1-/- mice and consequently rescue the RPE melanosomal phenotype More than 200 generic drugs were screened to identify the inhibitory activity on melanogenesis in mouse B16 melanoma cells. Cinnarizine and trazodone were identified as melanogenesis inhibitors. The inhibitory effects of the two drugs on cell survival, melanogenesis, and tyrosinase activity were investigated. The results showed that both cinnarizine and trazodone inhibited melanogenesis in B16 cells by a dose-dependent manner at the non-cytotoxic concentrations. Based on the results of the present study, seeking new melanogenesis inhibitors from generic drugs is an alternative approach to developing new depigmenting agents in cosmeceuticals. Moreover, cinnarizine and trazodone were proven to be good candidates as skin-whitening agents for treatment of skin hyperpigmentation Acknowledgements This research was supported by grants from the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Nos. 31172438 and U1205123), the Natural Science Foundation of Fujian Province (No. 2012J06008 and 201311180002) and the projects-sponsored by SRF.

58c8c132-be2f-465c-a20a-c0d7d19d9f74	online shopping	"The growth of e-retail has been a major discussion in the shopping characteristics of contemporary society. This has been a major concern as people strive to relate the exponential growth of online shopping to the recent decline in the growth of shopping malls. Various studies have significantly investigated the growth of online shopping and have always mentioned the impact of online shopping on shopping malls to be a negative one. This study focuses on testing that hypothesis. By exploring the possible relationship between certain factors such as the number of shopping malls and the percentage increase in online shopping retail, this study performs an analysis to prove this common assertion that online shopping negatively impacts shopping malls. The study uses Amazon online shopping company as a representation of the entire online shopping platform in the US. The analysis is carried via multiple linear regressions on the online shopping characteristics and those of the shopping malls The objective of this study is to propose a revised technology acceptance model that integrates expectation confirmation theory to measure gender differences with regard to continuance online shopping intentions in Saudi Arabia.
The sample was 465-respondent sample consists of 68.8% women and 31.4% men. A structural equation model confirms model fit. The research findings confirm that Perceived usefulness, enjoyment, and subjective norms are determinants of online shopping continuance in Saudi Arabia. Both male and female groups are equivalent. The structural weights are also largely equivalent, but the regression paths from perceived usefulness to subjective norms and to continuous intention are not invariant between men and women.
This research moves beyond online shopping intentions and includes factors affecting online shopping continuance. The research model explains 65% of the intention to continue shopping online. The research findings suggest that online strategies cannot ignore either the direct and indirect gender differences on continuance intentions in Saudi Arabia. The model can be generalized across Saudi Arabia Examines trends in online shopping and the use of online services, comparing survey data by gender, age, race/ethnicity, education, income, and region. Analyzes attitudes toward online shopping and services, with a focus on low-income Internet users This study proposes a revised technology acceptance model that integrates expectation confirmation theory to measure student gender differences with regard to continuance online shopping intentions in Saudi Arabia. The 234-respondent sample consists of 61.5% women and 38.5% men. A structural equation model confirms model fit. 
Perceived usefulness, enjoyment, and subjective norms are determinants of online shopping continuance in Saudi Arabia. Both male and female groups are equivalent. The structural weights are also largely equivalent, but the regression paths from subjective norms to enjoyment and subjective norms to continuance intention (in the men sample) and perceived usefulness to continuous intention (in the women sample) are not supported.
The model was operationally generalized across the whole of Saudi Arabia. This research moves beyond online shopping intentions and includes factors affecting online shopping continuance. The research model explains 71% of the intention to continue shopping online.
This research suggests that online strategies cannot ignore either the direct or indirect gender differences on continuance intentions in Saudi Arabia. The model can be generalized across Saudi Arabia Searching product information or buying goods online is becoming increasingly popular and could affect shopping trips. However, the relationship between e-shopping and in-store shopping is currently unclear. The aim of this study is to investigate empirically how the frequencies of online searching, online buying, and non-daily shopping trips relate to each other, after controlling for sociodemographic, land use, behavioral, and attitudinal characteristics. Data were collected from 826 respondents residing in four municipalities (one urban, three suburban) in the center of the Netherlands, using a shopping survey. Structural Equation Modeling was used to give insight in the mutual dependencies of the endogenous variables, and in direct and indirect effects between variables. The findings suggest that complementarity or generation between e-shopping and in-store shopping seems to be more likely to occur than substitution. The more often people search online, the more shopping trips they tend to make. Frequent in-store shoppers also buy frequently online. Shop accessibility has a negative effect on the frequency of online searching; the more shops are nearby, the less often persons search online. However, shop accessibility influences the frequency of online buying positively; the more shops are nearby, the more often persons buy online. Urbanisation level affects e-shopping indirectly via Internet use: urban residents shop online more often than suburban residents do, because urban residents use the Internet more often. The objective of this study is to clarify the theoretical problem and identify factors that could explain the level of continuance intention of e-shopping in context of Saudi Arabia. The study proposes a revised technology acceptance model that integrates expectation confirmation theory to measure age differences with regard to continuance online shopping intentions. Structural equation model confirms model fit. The research findings confirm that Perceived
usefulness, enjoyment, and subjective norms are determinants of online shopping continuance. The structural weights are mostly equivalent between the young and old groups, but the regression path from subjective norms to perceived usefulness is not invariant, with that relationship being stronger for the younger respondents.
This research moves beyond online shopping intentions and includes factors affecting online shopping continuance. The model explains 65% of the intention to continue shopping online. The research findings suggest that online strategies cannot ignore either the direct and indirect effects on

74371031-c1a2-4212-979c-e4ae7dd29389	mammary gland	The objective of this study was to examine five different sources of RNA, namely mammary gland tissue (MGT), milk somatic cells (SC), laser microdissected mammary epithelial cells (LCMEC), milk fat globules (MFG) and antibody-captured milk mammary epithelial cells (mMEC) to analyze the bovine mammary gland transcriptome using RNA-Sequencing. Our results provide a comparison between different sampling methods (invasive and non-invasive) to define the transcriptome of mammary gland tissue and milk cells. This information will be of value to investigators in choosing the most appropriate sampling method for different research applications to study specific physiological states during lactation. One of the simplest procedures to study the transcriptome associated with milk appears to be the isolation of total RNA directly from SC or MFG released into milk during lactation. Our results indicate that the SC and MFG transcriptome are representative of MGT and LCMEC and can be used as effective and alternative samples to study mammary gland expression without the need to perform a tissue biopsy A considerable body of research indicates that mammary gland branching morphogenesis is dependent, in part, on the extracellular matrix (ECM), ECM-receptors, such as integrins and other ECM receptors, and ECM-degrading enzymes, including matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) and their inhibitors, tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinases (TIMPs). There is some evidence that these ECM cues affect one or more of the following processes: cell survival, polarity, proliferation, differentiation, adhesion, and migration. Both three-dimensional culture models and genetic manipulations of the mouse mammary gland have been used to study the signaling pathways that affect these processes. However, the precise mechanisms of ECM-directed mammary morphogenesis are not well understood. Mammary morphogenesis involves epithelial 'invasion' of adipose tissue, a process akin to invasion by breast cancer cells, although the former is a highly regulated developmental process. How these morphogenic pathways are integrated in the normal gland and how they become dysregulated and subverted in the progression of breast cancer also remain largely unanswered questions Macrophages are important regulators of branching morphogenesis during development and postnatally in the mammary gland. Regulation of macrophage dynamics during these processes can therefore have a profound impact on development. We demonstrate here that the developing mammary gland expresses high levels of inflammatory CC-chemokines, which are essential in vivo regulators of macrophage migration. We further demonstrate that the atypical chemokine receptor ACKR2, which scavenges inflammatory CC-chemokines, is differentially expressed during mammary gland development. We have previously shown that ACKR2 regulates macrophage dynamics during lymphatic vessel development. Here, we extend these observations to reveal a novel role for ACKR2 in regulating the postnatal development of the mammary gland. Specifically, we show that Ackr2−/− mice display precocious mammary gland development. This is associated with increased macrophage recruitment to the developing gland and increased density of the ductal epithelial network. These data demonstrate that ACKR2 is an important regulator of branching morphogenesis in diverse biological contexts and provide the first evidence of a role for chemokines and their receptors in postnatal development processes The mammary gland is an organ with a remarkable regenerative capacity that can undergo multiple cycles of proliferation, lactation, and involution. Growing evidence suggests that these changes are driven by the coordinated division and differentiation of mammary stem cell populations (MaSC). Whereas information regarding MaSC and their role in comparative mammary gland physiology is readily available in human and mice, such information remains scarce in most veterinary mammal species such as cows, horses, sheep, goats, pigs, and dogs. We believe that a better knowledge on the MaSC in these species will not only help to gain more insights into mammary gland (patho) physiology in veterinary medicine, but will also be of value for human medicine. Therefore, this review summarizes the current knowledge on stem cell isolation and characterization in different mammals of veterinary importance The mammary gland is a highly regenerative organ that can undergo multiple cycles of proliferation, lactation, and involution. Based on the facts that (i) mammary stem/progenitor cells (MaSC) are proposed to be the driving forces behind mammary growth and function and (ii) variation exists between mammalian species with regard to physiological and pathological functioning of this organ, we believe that studying MaSC from different mammals is of great comparative interest. Over the years, important data has been gathered on MaSC of men and mice, although knowledge on MaSC in other mammals remains limited. Therefore, the aim of this work was to isolate and characterize MaSC from the mammary gland of horses. Hereby, our salient findings were that the isolated equine cells met the 2 in vitro hallmark properties of stem cells, namely the ability to self-renew and to differentiate into multiple cell lineages. Moreover, the cells were immunophenotyped using markers for CD29, CD44, CD49f, and Ki67. Finally, we propose the mammosphere assay as a valuable in vitro assay to study MaSC during different physiological phases since it was observed that equine lactating mammary gland contains significantly more mammosphere-initiating cells than the inactive, nonlactating gland (a reflection of MaSC self-renewal) and, moreover, that these spheres were significantly larger in size upon initial cultivation (a reflection of progenitor cell proliferation). Taken together, this study not only extends the current knowledge of mammary gland biology, but also benefits the comparative approach to study and compare MaSC in different mammalian species BackgroundIdentification and characterization of molecular controls that regulate mammary stem and progenitor cell homeostasis are critical to our understanding of normal mammary gland development and its pathology.ResultsWe demonstrate that conditional knockout of Sox9 in the mouse mammary gland results in impaired postnatal development. In short-term lineage tracing in the postnatal mouse mammary gland using Sox9-CreER driven reporters, Sox9 marked primarily the luminal progenitors and bipotent stem/progenitor cells within the basal mammary epithelial compartment. In contrast, long-term lineage tracing studies demonstrate that Sox9+ precursors gave rise to both luminal and myoepithelial cell lineages. Finally, fate mapping of Sox9 deleted cells demonstrates that Sox9 is essential for luminal, but not myoepithelial, lineage commitment and proliferation.ConclusionsThese studies identify Sox9 as a key regulator of mammary gland development and stem/progenitor maintenance AbstractWe have investigated the activity of STAT family members throughout a mammary developmental cycle. Transcripts for Stat 5 were upregulated during pregnancy whilst STAT1 and STAT3 mRNAs were expressed at constant levels. DNA binding complexes containing both STAT5a and 5b showed differing affinities for two naturally occurring STAT5 binding sites. In the involuting mammary gland STAT5 activity decreased whereas STAT3 was specifically activated. These observations reveal a complex pattern of activation of STAT factors during mammary growth, differentiation and remodelling and provide the first evidence for the involvement of STAT3 in development of the mammary gland Background Information about the effects of unsaturated fatty acids (UFA) supplementation on the health and integrity of the mammary gland in lactating dairy cows is lacking. Therefore, the aim of this study was to determine the effects of unprotected dietary UFA on the global expression pattern of genes in the mammary gland tissue of grazing dairy cows, and to translate this information into relevant biological knowledge. Methods Twenty-eight Holstein-Friesian dairy cows were randomly assigned to 4 different concentrated UFA-sources for 23 days after which all cows were switched to a non-UFA-supplemented concentrate for an additional 28 days. On the last day of both periods, mammary gland biopsies were taken to study genome-wide differences in gene expression on Bovine Genome Arrays. Results Supplementation with UFA reduced the concentration of short chain fatty acids (FA), C16 FA and saturated FA in the milk, whereas that of trans-FA increased. One major finding was that canonical pathways associated with remodelling and immune functions of the mammary gland were predominantly down-regulated during UFA supplementation and negatively correlated with the concentration of milk trans-FA. Conclusions Supplementing grazing dairy cows with unprotected dietary UFA can affect the remodelling and immune functions of the mammary gland with potential consequences for its integrity and health, as well as milk quality	['34055315', '85864687', '37884894', '31308213', '31275109', '85860056', '8985257', '17472475']	"[[{'name': 'Bevilacqua, Claudia'}, {'name': 'Boutinaud, Marion'}, {'name':

La simulazione nella didattica medica si è già ampiamente evoluta rispetto alle sue fasi iniziali. L’introduzione dei simulatori di pazienti umani, intorno alla fine del XX secolo, rappresenta una tappa fondamentale nella scienza dell’educazione in sanità. Fino ad oggi l’attenzione degli sviluppatori si è concentrata da un lato sulla capacità dei simulatori di dare feedback verosimili e coerenti con il comportamento del paziente e con la fisiologia umana e dall’altro sull’interazione fra simulatore e utilizzatore.

Le emergenti tecnologie nel campo della percezione sensoriale apporteranno miglioramenti significativi sia nella formazione in simulazione che nella gestione della simulazione stessa. Basandosi sull’analisi delle tecnologie attualmente disponibili e in via di sviluppo, questo scritto vuole essere uno sforzo di visioning sul futuro delle tecniche di simulazione. Nano-sensori e nano-attuatori, usati nella realtà aumentata/virtuale/ mista, permetteranno sia la concettualizzazione di sistemi capaci di aumentare il livello di realismo e di immersione sensoriale ma anche di mappare i movimenti e le azioni al fine di generare protocolli univoci di intervento. Proiettandoci in un ipotetico 2025, la simulazione medica sarà un’esperienza democratica, largamente accessibile, dinamica e immersiva a 360°, grazie alle tecniche di implementazione neuro-percettive.Practice is a key component of skills learning and maintenance in many health disciplines and simulation offers the opportunity to practice in a safe and effective manner improving patient safety.

Simulation for healthcare training has already evolved through its initial historical phases. The introduction of human patient simulator toward the end of the 20th century was a milestone in health sciences education.

To date the attention of developers has been paid to the capability of the simulator to give feedback, consistent with patient behavior and physiologic response, and the interaction between simulator and users.

The emerging technologies in the field of sensorial perception will bring improvements both in education and in management of the simulation. Grounding on the analysis of current and under-development technology, the manuscript is an attempt of visioning simulation-based training in health education in a coming future. Nano-sensors and nano-actuators, used in augmented/virtual/mixed reality, will allow the conceptualization of systems increasing the level of realism and the sensorial immersion, and the mapping of movements and action in order to generate univocal protocols of intervention. Projecting ourselves in 2025, medical simulation will be a democratic, largely accessible, dynamic and 360° sensorial experience, thanks to techniques of neuro-perceptive implementation Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is a genetically heterogeneous malignant clonal disorder of the hematopoietic system. Treatment of older patients with AML is quite challenging, an older age is independently associated with an inferior outcome. Hypomethylating agents such as 5-azacytidine and decitabine, has shown to be a promising option for older patients with AML, who are not suitable candidates for intensive therapies. Venetoclax (VEN) is an oral, potent, and selective BCL2 inhibitor. Synergistic activity against myeloid malignancies is seen in vitro and in vivo with VEN in combination with lower intensity antileukemia therapy, such as low-dose cytarabine (LDAC) or hypomethylating agents (HMA). This project, aims to analyze the response of AML patients to Venetoclax and monitored by MRD assay (multiparameter flow cytometry or MFC)

We will collect data on consecutive patients affected by de novo or secondary AML according to WHO 2016 criteria, in relapse or refractory phase of disease. Data will include clinical data and response data (minimal residual disease tested by multiparameter flow cytometry or MFC).

The combined therapy of Venetoclax and HMA resulted in good responses, especially in chemo-refractory patients and allogeneic transplant candidates. The quality of the responses made it possible, in a good percentage, to achieve allogeneic transplantation in MRD-negativity conditions.

The recurrence of treatment-associated neutropenia was the most frequent reason for temporary treatment discontinuation, consequently a document for the management of neutropenia was drawn up, derived from the various indications in the literature.

Despite the good results achieved, resistance to venetoclax and the possibility of discontinuing treatment once deep and lasting complete remission has been achieved remain open questions Increases in life expectancy have been followed by an upsurge of age-associated changes and pathologies. This brings important challenges to society. A central issue concerns the growth of the
incidence of age-associated cognitive decline. As people grow older, the structural and functional changes that occur in their brain lead to an overall deterioration of cognitive functioning, potentially compromising quality of life and social interaction. There has been an upsurge of attention in exploring non-pharmacological strategies to prevent or delay the impact of mild cognitive impairment. The paper aims to discuss different interventions approaches particularly cognitive training or rehabilitation interventions evaluating their effects to improve cognitive function among individuals with
MCI. Several interventions proposed and implemented to slow or reverse these cognitive impairments show promise, but future studies should consider also how overcome barriers to the prompt diagnosis of MCI in individuals and physician’s perceptions in order to successfully promote healthy aging and prevent or slow down age-associated cognitive decline Background. Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA) is a highly invalidating, chronic, progressive disease; it represents the 2% of all rheumatic diseases and it is related to very high costs for both civil society and health systems. Since many efficacious therapeutic options are now available (in particular the so-called biologic drugs) and because of the high costs related to these therapies, pharmaco-economic studies are becoming a useful tool for the optimization of health system-related budgets.

Methods. Review of the literature for pharmaco-economic studies in RA. Efficacy, safety and pharmaco-economic retrospective analysis in a large monocentric cohort of patients treated with a TNF-inhibitor (first biologic line with infliximab - IFX), etanercept – ETN, or adalimumab - ADA); the database covers a follow-up of 10 years.

Results. The review of the literature reported that annual direct costs for managing a patient with RA in Italy range from € 1.643 (1st stage of disease) to € 5.697 (4th stage of disease), while indirect costs range from € 2.705 to € 17.249. ADA monotherapy at the standard 40 mg every other week dose costed € 13.451/year while costs raised up to € 26.369 when the drug was administred at the dose 40 mg/week. The cost of ETN was € 13.582. In the case of combination therapy with methotrexate (MTX) the costs were € 13.637 for ADA and € 13.855 for ETN.

The 3 TNF-inhibitors were highly efficacious in significantly reducing disease activity and were well tolerated (with no significant difference for the 3 molecules).

Conclusion. In our experience, TNF-alfa inhibitors demonstrated to be an efficacious and safe therapeutic option, in particular in patients with moderate-to-severe disease activity. In the future, prospectic studies implementing extensive quality of life assessment (e.g. calculation of QALY) must be warranted, in order to produced detailed real-life pharmaco-economic evaluations Joint fluid aspiration, or arthrocentesis, is one of the most useful and commonly performed procedures for the diagnosis and treatment of rheumatic diseases, but to date no definite guidelines have been published. For this reason, a group of experts of the Italian Society of Rheumatology (SIR) produced evidence based recommendations for performing arthrocentesis. Among them, the most relevant are: a) arthrocentesis is necessary when synovial effusion of unknown origin is present, especially if septic or crystal arthritis is suspected; b) the patient should be clearly informed of the benefits and risks of the procedure in order to give an informed consent; c) ultrasonography should be used to facilitate arthrocentesis in difficult joints; d) fluid evacuation often has a therapeutic effect and facilitates the success of the following intraarticular injection; e) careful skin disinfection and the use of sterile, disposable material is mandatory for avoiding septic complications. Disposable, non sterile gloves should always be used by the operator, mainly for his own protection; f) contraindications are the presence of skin lesions or infections in the area of the puncture; g) the patient's anticoagulant treatment is not a contraindication, providing the therapeutic range is not exceeded; h) joint rest after arthrocentesis is not indicated. Several of these recommendations were based on experts' opinion rather than on published evidence which is scanty Management and prevention of sharps and needlestick injuries in nursing students. 
Aim:Investigate the knowledge, the personal perception of risk  and describe the epidemiology of  sharps and needlestick injuries in nursing students during clinical placements developing  a validated questionnaire.
Design: a cross-sectional observational study.
Methods: a  self-administered questionnaire consisting of three sections (demographic data; injury epidemiology; and predictive factors of sharps and needlestick injuries) was developed. Data were collected between July 2018 - January 2019 from nursing students during their clinical placements. Content validity was assessed by a panel of experts, who scored each item on a 4-point Likert scale. This study followed the STROBE guidelines.
Results: Of the 238 participants, 39% had been injured at least once with a sharp or a needle, of which 67.3% in the second year. A higher perception of \u2018Personal exposure\u2019 (4.06, SD 3.78) was reported by third-year students, whereas higher scores for \u2018Perceived benefits\u2019 of implementing preventive behaviours (13.63, SD 1.46) were reported by second-year students.
Conclusion
Our findings on the prevalence of sharps and needlestick injuries were in line with the literature. The questionnaire effectively investigated the epidemiology of occupational needlestick and sharps injuries, and knowledge and risk perception in nursing students"	['50507500', '22973964', '134487437', '84431455', '19732322', '12111833', '44033335']	[[{'name': 'Bisson, Mario'}, {'name': 'Ianniello, Alessandro'}, {'name': 'Ingrassia Pier, Luigi'}, {'name': 'Volontè, Fabio'}], [{'name': 'Abbenante, Mariachiara <1984>'}], [{'name': 'Pino O.'}], [{'name': 'Buratti, L.'}, {'name': 'Ciocci, A.'}, {'name': 'Coari, G.'}, {'name': 'Di Franco, M.'}, {'name': 'Iagnocco, Annamaria'}, {'name': 'Mauceri, M.

As technology evolves very rapidly, research and development in this area are very much required. This paper presents a detailed review of a variety of electric vehicles. The technological performance review discussed here will help researchers to move the research rapidly. In this paper, the author outlines and formulates a structural framework for understanding the optimality in the case of electric vehicles and hybrid electric vehicles With the development of electronic components so that it can be seen that technological progress is very rapid, the latest innovations are needed in utilizing these technological developments, this can be implemented in the technology of making automatic toilet tools that are very useful for the blind. The toilet is the place most frequented by everyone. However, there are things that are not very easy for the blind to use toiet, due to the factor of not being able to see so that they have difficulty in opening the toilet door and flushing water in the closet automatically, so there is a need for an automatic system and providing information provided in the form of audio sound that there are users of the toilet, In the manufacture of smart toilet automatic tools that can help users among the blind, called smart because it can open the door automatically and turn on the audio sound information and can release water automatically with a dc water pump motor, this is because it uses PIR and infrared sensors as a detector of the presence or absence of toilet users controlled by Arduino Uno, if there is a toilet user, Arduino Uno will process and command the audio will provide information in the form of sound and Motor DC water pump releases water automatically, then if the user has left the toilet and the infrared sensor no longer detects, then Motor DC water pump does not release water. After some analysis and testing, the results show that all functions run as expected. This smart toilet system can be implemented in an actual toilet without having to change the previous conditions at a small cost This paper proposed the design of a remote temperature monitoring system of R125 Shinva's automatic filling machine. The R125 Shinvaâ€™s automatic filling machine is one of the machines on SF company which main function is fulfilling the infusion liquid into the infusion packaging, this infusion liquid is mainly used for the human medical treatment. Based on the failure history data, this machine has the highest downtime among the others and one of the fatal failures is caused by the overheating of the heating element in the infusion liquid bag's transfer system. Using the proposed design, the temperature of the heating element can be monitored in real-time condition and also giving notification to the maintenance team for the next maintenance action. With the power of cloud-based technology, the monitoring system not only on-site monitoring but also can use a web server monitoring, and mobile monitoring system A prototype soil moisture based an automated irrigation system were developed at National Maize Research Program in 2018 to study the water requirement of drought tolerant crop genotype. The irrigation system has been controlled by Arduino UNO as a micro controller. The instant soil moisture data were collected either in Excel format or graphical format using internet of things through the programming of Global System for Mobile Communication: Subscriber Identity Module (GSM:SIM card) of Nepal Telecom. The developed automated irrigation system has found maintained the predetermined threshold soil moisture. This automated irrigation system has been developed to make applicable for drip irrigation system which has operated at low water pressure maintained by 1.5² professional-grade solenoid valve. The introduction of this automated irrigation system has developed the base for Nepalese agricultural scientist in designing and promoting irrigation technology to make Nepalese agricultural more sustainable, mechanized and productive This paper proposed the design of a remote temperature monitoring system of R125 Shinva's automatic filling machine.

debd15cc-8ec0-4b6a-9f40-7417c1448c67	asylum	"In many European countries a traditional policy and legal response to an undesirable increase of asylum applications has been the change of asylum law and procedures. By making it more difficult to obtain asylum and refugee status, the attractiveness as a possible country of asylum is believed to diminish. In the period from 1992 to 2003 three major revisions of the Belgian asylum procedure were enacted. When speaking in absolute figures these changes resulted in a certain decrease in the number of asylum applications filed. However, upon a closer examination of the number of asylum applications per country of origin, the effects appeared to be quite differential. Hence, factors other than geographical ones, such as the location of the country of origin or distance, must be decisive for the effect of a change in legislation on the number of asylum claimants coming from one particular country. Nevertheless, it has been possible to distinguish seven clusters of countries of origin where similar developments in patterns of asylum applications and shifts therein, depending on changes in asylum law, can be seen The problematization of asylum has detrimentally impacted on the provision of support for asylum seekers in host countries. The threat of destitution has become instrumental in restrictive asylum policies and is increasingly used as a deterrent against asylum seeking. The EU experience reveals acute tensions between the EU asylum agenda and the EU Member States' obligations under international refugee and human rights law. The provision of support for asylum seekers challenges narrow approaches to the realization of socio-economic rights for ""others"" and to host countries' duties in that respect. The EU Reception Conditions Directive, which aims to set out standards for the reception of asylum seekers across the Union, exemplifies this predicament. Yet international refugee and human rights law provides a legal framework that establishes minimum standards critical to dignified living for asylum seekers and the protection of the right to seek refugee status in the EU and beyond Snapshot of the state of asylum seekers\u27 rights in the United States and the UK at the time it was written.  It provides an overview of U.S. and UK obligations to asylum seekers under international human rights law.  The Comment also discusses the basics of U.S. and UK domestic law and procedure relevant to claims for asylum.  The author advocates that the United State and the UK adopt a comprehensive approach to preserve asylum seekers\u27 rights and concludes that domestic law should not become a pretext for human rights violations of asylum seekers in the post-September 11th world Reforms of the system around the accommodation and support needs of asylum seekers entering the United Kingdom (UK), during the twentieth and early twenty-first centuries have meant that the support of asylum seekers has largely moved away from mainstream social work to be based within dedicated asylum support teams. This article investigates how the workers engaged as asylum support workers understand and make sense of their participation in the support of asylum seekers dispersed across the UK. By drawing upon qualitative research with asylum support workers this paper looks at how such workers make sense of their roles and how the ‘support’ of asylum seekers is conceived. The paper concludes that by working within this political and controversial area of work, workers are constantly finding ways to negotiate their support role within a dominant framework of control This article examines New Labour policies on asylum with a focus on changes in welfare provision. The changes that have taken place have resulted in the exclusion of asylum seekers from 'mainstream' provision and have led to an increase in poverty and destitution among some asylum seekers Snapshot of the state of asylum seekers\u27 rights in the United States and the UK at the time it was written.  It provides an overview of U.S. and UK obligations to asylum seekers under international human rights law.  The Comment also discusses the basics of U.S. and UK domestic law and procedure relevant to claims for asylum.  The author advocates that the United State and the UK adopt a comprehensive approach to preserve asylum seekers\u27 rights and concludes that domestic law should not become a pretext for human rights violations of asylum seekers in the post-September 11th world Several scholars have argued that European countries have decided to cooperate on asylum and migration matters at the EU level in order to develop more restrictive policies. In particular, it has been argued that European states have ‘venue-shopped’ to a new policy-venue in order to escape national constraints. This paper puts this

argument to the test by assessing the extent to which the development of EU cooperation on asylum matters has indeed led to the adoption of more restrictive asylum standards. The paper argues that, actually, EU asylum cooperation has led to an overall increase in protection standards for asylum-seekers and refugees. This outcome is explained by two main factors: the increasing ‘judicialisation’ of asylum

in the EU and institutional changes in the EU asylum policy area that have strengthened the role of more ‘refugee-friendly’ institutions The plight of refugees-those who flee persecution-touches a chord with Americans, who have supported both a substantial overseas resettlement program and a fair system for asylum seekers. U.S. laws provide a seemingly full opportunity for asylum applicants to explain their fear or actual experience of persecution. In fact, the U.S. offers an extensive process of interviews, hearings, and appeals to ensure that bona fide refugees are not sent back to their persecutors. The substantive law, too, has been developed considerably through administrative and judicial precedents. But how meaningful is a process that, no matter how extensive and developed, leaves asylum seekers on their own to present their claims when only experts understand how the process works and what the case law means?
Asylum applicants often have escaped life threatening situations in their home countries and have overcome financial and physical obstacles to reach the United States, only to be faced with a daunting and confusing asylum application process. Legal assistance is permitted, but it must be at no expense to the government. While some asylum seekers find competent representation, many do not. Most of the key players in the U.S. asylum process-the representatives, the Immigration and Naturalization Service ( INS ) trial attorneys, the Asylum Officers and the Immigration Judges– believe that representation makes a difference for those seeking relief and for the effectiveness of the system. Immigration Court data indicates that represented asylum cases are four to six times more likely to succeed than pro se ones. The time has come to develop ways for all asylum seekers to have the type of legal assistance needed to more fully ensure that bona fide refugees receive the protection that the U.S. public wants to give them and that our laws require.
Despite the importance of legal representation, there has yet to be a systematic evaluation of the effectiveness of the current delivery mechanisms in place to aid those in need of legal services and the effect of representation on the asylum system in general. This paper examines the state of affairs with regard to asylum representation and attempts to understand better the barriers to representation. It also begins to assess the effects of representation on asylum seekers and the asylum system itself, and to analyze the various ways in which the representation system can be improved SUMMARY

d42c9ba9-8ed1-4259-96cd-5a35a5597e4f	computer	"Artificial intelligence (AI) conversational chatbots have gained popularity over time, and have been widely used in the fields of e-commerce, online banking, and digital healthcare and well-being, among others. The technology has the potential to provide personalised service to a range of consumers. However, the use of chatbots within educational settings is still limited. In this paper, we present three chatbot prototypes, the Warwick Manufacturing Group, University of Warwick, are currently developing, and discuss the potential opportunities and technical challenges we face when considering AI chatbots to support our daily activities within the department. Three AI virtual agents are under development: 1) to support the delivery of a taught Master's course simulation game; 2) to support the training and use of a newly introduced educational application; 3) to improve the processing of helpdesk requests within a university department. We hope this paper is informative to those interested in using chatbots in the educational domain. We also aim to improve awareness among those within the chatbot development industry, in particular the chatbot engine providers, about the educational and operational needs within educational institutes, which may differ from those in other domains in the global telecommunication industry. Hence, a dominant approach for subscriber

management and retention is churn control, since it is cheaper to retain an existing

subscriber than acquiring a new one. Predictive modeling employs the use of data mining

techniques to identify patterns and provide a result that a group of subscribers are likely to

churn in the near future. However, the effectiveness of subscriber retention strategy in an

organization can be further boosted if the reason for churn and the timing of churn can also

be predicted.

In this paper, we propose a data mining process framework that can be used to predict

churn, determine when a subscriber is likely to churn, provides the reason why a subscriber

may churn, and recommend appropriate intervention strategy for customer retention using

a combination of statistical and machine learning techniques. This experiment is carried

out using data from a major telecom operator in Nigeria Electrophysiological methods were used to test the visual sensitivity of European grapevine moth, Lobesia botrana (Lepidoptera: Tortricidae) to wavelengths ranging from 300 to 700 nm. For male and females tested, a main, peak response occurred in the 460-540 nm range (blue-green wavelengths) with females having a generally lower response to wavelengths in that range. A second smaller peak was observed for both sexes at the 340-420 nm range. A general linear model indicated that males, virgin females, and mated females did not react differently to changes in wavelength. No moths showed any obvious sensitivity to wavelengths between 580 and 700 nm. Based on our retinal recording data we suggest that UV light traps (≤480 nm) could be utilized alongside pheromone traps when monitoring L. botrana in high risk areas This study examined the influence of classroom-script structure (high vs. low) during computer-supported collaborative inquiry learning on help-seeking processes and learning gains in 54 student pairs in secondary science education. Screen- and audio-capturing videos were analysed according to a model of the help-seeking process. Results show that the structure of the classroom script substantially affects patterns of student help seeking and learning gain in the classroom. Overall, students in the high-structured classroom-script condition sought less help but learnt more than those in the low-structured classroom-script condition System synchronizes data transfer between two computers by generating data strobe pulses when computers are ready for data transfer. In addition, interface filters noise by sampling The great popularity and rapid diffusion of mobile technologies at worldwide level has also been recognised by the public sector, leading to the creation of m-government. A major challenge for m-government is accessibility – the provision of an equal service to all citizens irrespective of their psychical, mental or technical capabilities. This paper sketches the profiles of six citizen groups: Visually Impaired, Hearing Impaired, Motor Impaired, Speech Impaired, Cognitive Impaired and Elderly. M-government examples that target the aforementioned groups are discussed and a framework for accessible m-government implementation with reference to the W3C Mobile Web Best Practices is proposed"	['76724739', '7293674', '127598362', '5233212', '4471851', '532994', '160802007']	[[{'name': 'Evans, Chris'}, {'name': 'Yang, Shanshan, (Researcher in computer science)'}], [{'name': 'Daramola, Olawande'}, {'name': 'Oladipupo, O.

3-part of the Tate-Shafarevich group.Comment: 17 page The centenary of World War One was marked in the UK by an unprecedented national investment in the creative arts as a vehicle for remembrance. This scale of funding for commemorative arts, not least under a government whose mantra had been economic “austerity”, demonstrates the importance that the nation-state placed on remembrance and on engaging the public in acts of memory through the arts. In the aftermath of the centenary, funding bodies have commissioned evaluations of this programming. These evaluations have focused on audiences reached, organisations benefitted, and social transformation. What remain occluded by the reports are the experiences of the artists themselves and the curators with whom they worked. In this article I explore the personal and affective experiences of several artists and curators whose work contributed to this national programme of remembrance. I ask: to what extent did artists and curators consciously engage with prior artistic responses to World War One? How did the context of collective commemoration and memory-making inform their practice and the works produced? What did their involvement in this programme of national remembrance make them feel? What were the narratives of the war they wanted to tell? To begin to answer these questions, I draw on a series of one-to-one interviews conducted with a number of artists and curators who were involved in commemorative projects in the UK and overseas The Los Angeles County Arts Commission surveyed teaching artists and arts organizations to find out who provided arts education services to LA County's 2,198 public schools in 2012. This survey found 139 arts organizations and 46 teaching artists providing arts education during the school day in 98 percent of all school districts and 53 percent of all schools in the County. While this is certainly an undercount of the total number of such arts organizations and teaching artists serving local public schools, it is a first step toward establishing a comprehensive list, and is the best data we have to date about this group of providers. Among the high level findings: 57 percent of all arts education provided by community arts partners was in visual art (32 percent) and music/opera (25 percent).More than 77 percent of arts education provided by community arts partners occured in elementary (K-8) grades. Arts education from community arts partners peaked in grades 3 through 5, and peak years varied by arts discipline.The four community arts pertners providing the greatest amount of arts educatio in LA County were the Autry Museum, Broad Stage, Music Center and Skirball Cultural Center.Nearly half of all community arts partners charge schools for their services at least some of the time For historians of medieval Iberian art and architecture, María Rosa Menocal’s most important legacy lies in her work’s normalization of a culturally decentralized, multidisciplinary frame through which medieval visual objects became part of a broadly shared network of cultural production that was unrestricted by firm boundaries between particular polities or “faith groups.” While Menocal was not the first to advance such an approach, her persuasive promotion of it in works such as The Ornament of the World and the co-authored The Arts of Intimacy dovetailed closely with concurrent trends within the discipline of art history: new attentiveness to the variability of the Iberian cultural economy; a renewed concern with questions of reception and meaning; revived emphasis on close, contextual readings; and an openness to extra-disciplinary methodologies. The conceptual and disciplinary flexibility that Menocal’s work encouraged now lies at the very heart of current work on Iberian visual culture An annotated list of new records or otherwise interesting species from Ecuador is presented.

Bartram Arts Funding IV: An Update on Foundation Trends examines changes in U.S. foundation support for arts and culture, arts-related humanities, and the media through 2001. The report also places foundation arts giving within the context of changes in public and private support for the arts and in foundation funding overall. In addition, Arts Funding IV provides estimates of total foundation giving for the arts in 2002 and suggests the direction of change in foundations' arts giving over the next few years This report analyzes data from the 1982, 1985, 1992, 2002, and 2008 Surveys of Public Participation in the Arts (SPPA). Analyses focus on differential arts participation by race/ethnicity and the effect of race/ethnicity on arts participation. Descriptive and inferential analyses explore trends in arts participation by race/ethnicity across the five rounds of SPPA data. The authors find that, generally, the numbers and proportions of all race/ethnic groups that participate in the arts through attendance at arts events and arts creation are declining over time. The proportion of arts audiences that is white is not declining, despite the fact that the proportion of the national population that is white is declining. Race/ethnic group, per se, is not a strong predictor of attendance at arts events, but it is a good predictor of arts creation activities. Whites and Asians have had arts learning experiences at a greater rate than have blacks and Hispanics.

The model is built from individual forward looking agents adopting a portfolio selection scheme similar to the portfolio selection theory devised by Markowitz. We allow agents to use past and present price information to forecast both the expected return and the variance of asset returns, but with possibly different econometric forecasting techniques. Since the effects of price dependent preferences of agents are complicated, we use Microscopic Simulations to investigate the effects on equilibrium asset prices and on returns over an extended time period in a temporary equilibrium context. We also test whether the assumption of rational expectations makes sensemultiperiod CAPM, heterogeneous agents, price dependent preferences, microscopic simulations Research on the ‘ideal’ or ‘good’ student tends to be situated within compulsory schooling. Few recent studies have focused on lecturers’ conceptualisation and construction of the ‘ideal’ university student. Informed by 30 in-depth interviews with lecturers from two post-92 English universities within the social sciences, we explore how the notion of ‘ideal’ student is understood in contemporary higher education. We focus on lecturers’ expectations of undergraduate students, as well as their views of the ‘ideal’ student in different teaching and learning contexts. We identified specific personal and academic skillsets that are desirable of students, including preparation, engagement, commitment, as well as being critical, reflective and progressing. The ability to achieve high grades, interestingly, is rarely mentioned as important. Implications for policy and practice are discussed as we present a much-needed update on the current features of the ‘ideal’ university student, which can influence student experience, especially the lecturer-student relationship For network access, it is always desired that a fibre optic network connectivity be the major area of

cost minimization, while keeping quality of service as high as possible. This is because overall cost of

setting up a fibre optic cable route is usually very high in relation to other components of the network.

In this study, three buildings clusters were mapped to the University Network Operating Center, and

the network was developed as a fail-safe network, so that in the case of damage to a cable or

connecting component, users are not cut out. The problem was formulated as a Mathematical

Programming problem and solved the resulting transportation problem using MATLAB linear

programming solution. Results from the mathematical model shows an optimized cost for which a

For the current study Landsat ETM+ images of 2000, 2003, 2010 and OLI/TIRS 2015 were acquired from USGS of the study area. Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) was developed and NDVI based classification was used to calculate the vegetation area. The digital number of thermal infrared band is converted into spectral radiance using the equation supplied by the Landsat user’s hand book. The effective at-sensor brightness temperature has been obtained from the spectral radiance using Plank’s inverse function. The surface emissivity based on NDVI is used to retrieve the final LST. The research aims to investigate the spatial and temporal pattern of vegetation and land surface temperature and also to determine the correlation between land surface temperature and Vegetation in study area from 2000 to 2015. The results reveal decrease in vegetation area results in increase in the LST. The vegetation area decreases from 34 to 14.3 percent with average increase in LST mean from 39.8 to 44 degree Celsius from 2000-2015. The research suggested that more studies should be conducted with images and sensors of higher resolution and seasonal variation can be assessed for the LST PHBS adalah suatu kumpulan praktek perilaku atas dasar kesadaran dari hasil pembelajaran yang menjadikan seseorang keluarga, kelompok, atau masyarakat dapat menolong dirinya sendiri secara mandiri dalam bidang kesehatan sehingga dapat meningkatkan derajat kesehatan masyarakat. Metode yang digunakan dalam penyuluhan Perilaku Hidup Bersih dan Sehat adalah Ceramah dan Tanya Jawab. Setelah dilakukan penyuluhan didapatkan peningkatan pengetahuan masyarakat karena ketika penyuluhan pemateri memberikan motivasi sehingga masyarakat terdorong untuk menjaga kebersihan. Jika PHBS masyarakat tidak terjaga maka akan menimbulkan berbagai penyakit seperti diabetes, penyakit jantung, stroke, sindrome metabolik mencakup tekanan darah tinggi, gula darah tinggi, kelebihan lemak tubuh, dan kadar kolesterol yang tidak normal. Penyuluhan berlangsung selama 30 menit kemudian dilanjutkan dengan sesi tanya jawab. Dengan dilakukan penyuluhan ini akan meningkatkan pengetahuan dan kesadaran masyarakat dalam meningkatkan Perilaku Hidup Bersih dan Sehat. Sebelum dilakukan penyuluhan banyak masyarakat yang belum memahami mengenai PHBS Seperti tidak mencuci tangan menggunakan sabun, membuang sampah disembarang tempat. Penyuluhan Perilaku Hidup Bersih dan Sehat berjalan dengan baik, dihadiri 35 orang. Penyuluhan dilakukan dengan tujuan untuk meningkatkan kesadaran masyarakat mengenai pentingnya menjaga Perilaku Hidup Bersih dan Sehat.

Human papillomavirus (HPV) infection is a known precursor of cervical cancer and preventive measures include prophylactic vaccines. This study focused on sexually active Paraguayan women aged 18–25 years, exploring the intersection of HPV vaccination and sexual behavior. Among 254 participants, 40.9% received the Gardasil-4 vaccine, with no significant differences in sexual behavior between the vaccinated and unvaccinated sexually active groups. However, a notable decrease in the prevalence of HPV among the vaccinated women highlights the efficacy of this vaccine in reducing infections. The prevalence of any HPV type was 37.5% in vaccinated participants compared to 56.7% in unvaccinated participants (p = 0.0026). High-risk HPV types showed a significant difference, with a prevalence of 26.0% in vaccinated women compared with 52.7% in unvaccinated women (p < 0.001). Although a potential decline in genital warts was observed among the vaccinated individuals, statistical significance (p = 0.0564) was not reached. Despite the challenges in achieving high vaccination coverage, the observed reduction in HPV prevalence underscores the importance of ongoing monitoring, healthcare professional recommendations, and comprehensive risk management. These findings contribute to dispelling concerns about HPV vaccination influencing sexual behavior, advocating further large-scale research to explore the impact of vaccines on various HPV types and potential cross-protection.Consejo Nacional de Ciencia y TecnologíaPrograma Paraguayo para el Desarrollo de la Ciencia y Tecnología. Proyectos de investigación y desarroll The rise in international trade of plants and plant products has increased the risk of introduction and spread of plant pathogens and pests. In addition, new risks are arising from the implementation of more environmentally friendly methods of biodegradable waste disposal, such as composting and anaerobic digestion. As these disposal methods do not involve sterilisation, there is good evidence that certain plant pathogens and pests can survive these processes. The temperature/time profile of the disposal process is the most significant and easily defined factor in controlling plant pathogens and pests. In this review, the current evidence for temperature/time effects on plant pathogens and pests is summarised. The advantages and disadvantages of direct and indirect process validation for the verification of composting processes, to determine their efficacy in destroying plant pathogens and pests in biowaste, are discussed. The availability of detection technology and its appropriateness for assessing the survival of quarantine organisms is also reviewed Objective: Climate change is likely to affect the nature of pathogens and chemicals in the environment and their fate and transport. Future risks of pathogens and chemicals could therefore be very different from those of today. In this review, we assess the implications of climate change for changes in human exposures to pathogens and chemicals in agricultural systems in the United Kingdom and discuss the subsequent effects on health impacts. 



Data sources: In this review, we used expert input and considered literature on climate change ; health effects resulting from exposure to pathogens and chemicals arising from agriculture ; inputs of chemicals and pathogens to agricultural systems ; and human exposure pathways for pathogens and chemicals in agricultural systems. 



Data synthesis: We established the current evidence base for health effects of chemicals and pathogens in the agricultural environment ; determined the potential implications of climate change on chemical and pathogen inputs in agricultural systems ; and explored the effects of climate change on environmental transport and fate of different contaminant types. We combined these data to assess the implications of climate change in terms of indirect human exposure to pathogens and chemicals in agricultural systems. We then developed recommendations on future research and policy changes to manage any adverse increases in risks. 



Conclusions: Overall, climate change is likely to increase human exposures to agricultural contaminants. The magnitude of the increases will be highly dependent on the contaminant type. Risks from many pathogens and particulate and particle-associated contaminants could increase significantly. These increases in exposure can, however, be managed for the most part through targeted research and policy changes Kinetoplastids are a group of flagellated protozoans that include the species Trypanosoma and Leishmania, which are human pathogens with devastating health and economic effects. The sequencing of the genomes of some of these species has highlighted their genetic relatedness and underlined differences in the diseases that they cause. As we discuss in this Review, steady progress using a combination of molecular, genetic, immunologic, and clinical approaches has substantially increased understanding of these pathogens and important aspects of the diseases that they cause. Consequently, the paths for developing additional measures to control these “neglected diseases” are becoming increasingly clear, and we believe that the opportunities for developing the drugs, diagnostics, vaccines, and other tools necessary to expand the armamentarium to combat these diseases have never been better Mastitis in dairy cows is a significant economic and animal welfare issue in the dairy industry. The bacterial pathogens responsible for infection of the mammary gland may be split into two main categories: major and minor pathogens. Infection with major pathogens generally results in clinical illness or strong inflammatory responses and reduced milk yields, whereas minor pathogen infection is usually subclinical. Previous investigations have considered the transmission of these pathogens independently. Experimental evidence has shown cross-protection between species of pathogens. In this study a mathematical model for the coupled transmission of major and minor pathogens along with their interaction via the host was developed in order to consider various methods for controlling the incidence of major pathogen infection. A stability analysis of the model equilibria provides explanations for observed phenomena and previous decoupled modelling results. This multispecies model structure has provided a basis for quantifying the extent of cross-protection between species and assessing possible control strategies against the disease The global focus on wildlife as a major contributor to emerging pathogens and infectious diseases (EIDs) in humans and domestic animals is not based on field, experimental or dedicated research, but mostly on limited surveys of literature, opinion and the assumption that biodiversity harbours pathogens. The perceived and direct impacts of wildlife, from being a reservoir of certain human and livestock pathogens and as a risk to health, are frequently overstated when compared to the Global burden of disease statistics available from WHO, OIE and FAO. However organisms that evolve in wildlife species can and do spill-over into human landscapes and humans and domestic animal population and, where these organisms adapt to surviving and spreading amongst livestock and humans, these emerging infections can have significant consequences. Drivers for the spill-over of pathogens or evolution of organisms from wildlife reservoirs to become pathogens of humans and domestic animals are varied but almost without exception poorly researched. The changing demographics, spatial distribution and movements, associated landscape modifications (especially agricultural) and behavioural changes involving human and domestic animal populations are probably the core drivers of the apparent increasing trend in emergence of new pathogens and infectious diseases over recent decades"	['159441153', '233101', '233233', '130508', '232967', '10125828']	[[{'name': 'Araya, Soraya Angela Lorenza'}, {'name': 'Bobadilla Frizzola, María Liz'}, {'name': 'Castro, Héctor'}, {'name': 'Deluca, Gerardo'}, {'name': 'Salete de Paula, Vanessa'}, {'name': 'Villagra, Veronica'}, {'name': 'Von-Horoch, Marta'}], [{'name': 'Budge, G.

The most important chiral compounds were separated into their single enantiomers and tested. The impact of the substituents at N1, C3 and C5 positions as well the influence of the configuration of the C5 on the biological activity were analyzed. Bulky aromatic groups at C5 were not tolerated. p-Prenyloxyaryl moiety at C3 oriented the selectivity toward the B isoform. The results were also corroborated by molecular modelling studies providing new suggestions for the synthesis of privileged structures to serve as lead compounds for the treatment of mood disorders and neurodegenerative diseases A knowledge-based library of aryl 2,3-dichlorophenylsulfonamides was synthesised and screened as human CCR4 antagonists, in order to identify a suitable hit for the start of a lead-optimisation programme. X-ray diffraction studies were used to identify the pyrazole ring as a moiety that could bring about intramolecular hydrogen bonding with the sulfonamide NH and provide a clip or orthogonal conformation that was believed to be the preferred active conformation. Replacement of the core phenyl ring with a pyridine, and replacement of the 2,3-dichlorobenzenesulfonamide with 5- chlorothiophenesulfonamide provided compound 33 which has excellent physicochemical properties and represents a good starting point for a lead optimisation programme. Electronic structure calculations indicated that the preference for the clip or orthogonal conformation found in the small molecule crystal structures of 7 and 14 was in agreement with the order of potency in the biological assay The syntheses of 4-mercapto-2,6-di(pyrazol-1-yl)pyridine (bppSH) and bis[2,6-di(pyrazol-1-yl)pyrid-4-yl]disulfide (bppSSbpp) are reported. In contrast to previously published “back-to-back” bis-[2,6-di(pyrazol-1-yl)pyridine] derivatives, which form coordination polymers with transition ions that are usually insoluble, bppSSbpp yields soluble oligomeric complexes with iron(II) and zinc(II). Mass spectrometry and DOSY data show that [{Fe(μ-bppSSbpp)}n]2n+ and [{Zn(μ-bppSSbpp)}n]2n+ form tetranuclear metallacycles in nitromethane solution (n = 4), although 1H NMR and conductivity measurements imply the iron compound may undergo more fragmentation than its zinc congener. Both [{Fe(bppSH)2]2+ and [{Fe(μ-bppSSbpp)}n]2n+ exhibit thermal spin-crossover in CD3NO2 solution, with midpoint temperatures near 245 K. The similarity of these equilibria implies there is little cooperativity between the iron centres in the metallacyclic structures No description supplie RK acknowledges the Department of Science & Technology for the single-crystal X-ray diffractometer sanctioned as a National Facility under Project No. SR/S2/CMP-47/2003.Peer reviewe	['55041578', '7415000', '8364959', '130414', '8035380', '38518685']	"[[{'name': 'Carradori, Simone'}, {'name': 'Chimenti, Paola'}, {'name': 'Cirilli, Roberto'}, {'name': 'Guglielmi, Paolo'}, {'name': 'Petzer, Anél'}, {'name': 'Petzer, Jacobus P.'}, {'name': 'Poli, Giulio'}, {'name': 'Rotondi, Giulia'}, {'name': 'Secci, Daniela'}], [{'name': 'Copley, R.C.B.'}, {'name': 'Miah, A.H.'}, {'name': ""O'Flynn, D.""}, {'name': 'Percy, J.M.'}, {'name': 'Procopiou, P.A.'}], [{'name': 'Fisher, Julie'}, {'name': 'Halcrow, Malcolm A.'}, {'name': 'Harding, Lindsay P.'}, {'name': 'Kershaw Cook, Laurence J.'}], [{'name': 'Alan H.

Business analysis through enterprise budget was developed considering different feeding frequency and stocking density of the fish to predict the business efficiency of the system, and the net incomes were as high as AED 34,394 and AED 46,637, respectively. On the other hand, lettuce was seeded in a culture raceway. The duration of the experiments was decided to be six months, which was divided into two parts to study each parameter, i.e. feeding frequency (Once, twice and three times per day) and stocking density (100,120,140 fishes per cubic meter). In parallel, the aquaponic system water quality (pH, temperature, total dissolved solids, dissolved Oxygen, total ammonia, nitrite, and nitrate) and water consumption were analyzed at specified intervals. Furthermore, fish and cultivated plant growth rate and total yield were analyzed at the first and last days of the experimental period. The purpose of that was to optimize the system feeding system and stocking from different approaches both agriculturally and economically. It was found that highest used feeding frequency and stocking density are recommended to achieve high profitabilit Aquaponics is a signiﬁcant wastewater treatment system which refers to the combination of conventional aquaculture (raising aquatic organism) with hydroponics (cultivating plants in water) in a symbiotic environment. This system has a high ability in removing nutrients compared to conventional methods because it is a natural and environmentally friendly system (aquaponics). The current chapter aimed to review the possible application of aquaponics system to treat fresh market wastewater with the intention to highlight the mechanism of phytoremediation occurs in aquaponic system. The literature revealed that aquaponic system was able to remove nutrients in terms of nitrogen and phosphorus The paper aim was to estimate consumers’ knowledge about aquaponics and their acceptance of aquaponics products in different European regions. An on-line questionnaire was administered to the general public through the aquaponics network of Food and Agriculture COST (European Cooperation in Science and Technology) Action FA1305 “The EU Aquaponics Hub—RealisingSustainable Integrated Fish and Vegetable Production for the EU” in 16 European countries. The methodology includes univariate and multivariate statistical techniques. The results show that, on average, attitudes towards aquaponics were positive, showing no significant differences between those who already knew about aquaponics and those who only heard about it through the survey. More than 50% of respondents had never heard of aquaponics, whilst more than 70% had already heard of hydroponics. No more than 17% of respondents were willing to pay more for aquaponicallyproduced products and no more than 40% more when compared to the price of products from conventional farming. The results confirm three different clusters of potential consumers of aquaponics products.N/ Aquaponics (AP) is a semi-closed system of food production that combines aquaculture and hydroponics and represents a new agricultural system integrating producers and consumers. The aim of this study was to test the effect of stocking densities (APL, 2.5 kg m-3; APH, 4.6 kg m-3) on water quality, growth performance of the European Carp (Cyprinus carpio L.), and yield of leafy vegetables (catalogna, lettuce, and Swiss Chard) in a low-technology AP pilot system compared to a hydroponic cultivation. The AP daily consumption of
water due to evapotranspiration was not different among treatments with an average value of 8.2 L d-1, equal to 1.37% of the total water content of the system. Dissolved oxygen was
significantly (p < 0.05) different among treatments with the lowest median value recorded with the highest stocking density of fish (5.6 mg L-1) and the highest median value in the
hydroponic control (8.7 mg L-1). Marketable yield of the vegetables was significantly different among treatments with the highest production in the hydroponic control for catalogna
(1.2 kg m-2) and in the APL treatment for Swiss Chard (5.3 kg m-2). The yield of lettuce did not differ significantly between hydroponic control and APL system (4.0 kg m-2 on average).
The lowest production of vegetables was obtained in the APH system. The final weight (515 g vs. 413 g for APL and APH, respectively), specific growth rate (0.79% d-1 vs. 0.68% d-1),
and feed conversion (1.55 vs. 1.86) of European Carp decreased when stocking density increased, whereas total yield of biomass was higher in the APH system (4.45 kg m-3 vs.
6.88 kg m-3). A low mortality (3% on average) was observed in both AP treatments. Overall, the results showed that a low initial stocking density at 2.5 kg m-3 improved the production
of European Carp and of leafy vegetables by maintaining a better water quality in the tested AP system According to the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization, 60% of East Africans live as subsistence farmers. This population is particularly vulnerable to the effects of climate change which has increased the duration and intensity of droughts and floods. Droughts and floods can destroy an entire season’s harvest, causing sustenance farmers and their families to struggle for food until the next season. In an attempt to mitigate the severe effects of climate change on these farmers and reduce food insecurity in East Africa, the team has designed a small-scale aquaponic farming system that simultaneously grows fish and vegetables. This system is founded on sustainability, as aquaponics uses significantly less water to grow crops than traditional farming, making it more resilient to both severe droughts and floods, the system also does not rely on external fertilizers, and it uses recycled materials as often as possible.
This aquaponic system was designed for women’s collectives in East Africa who requested help in building a portfolio of projects that they can teach to women in rural East Africa. These women’s organizations work in rural villages throughout Uganda and Kenya to help local women and their families adapt to the changing climate. Currently, their efforts have been focused on improving the quality and supply of water in the villages by constructing latrines, water filters, and rainwater catchment systems.
During the 2017-2018 academic year, team members designed and built the aquaponic system in Santa Clara, California, then deployed the first prototype in Kampala, Uganda, and trained several of the collective’s leaders how to build and operate the system This research investigates various methods for producing food on the campus of Gettysburg College in order to improve food sustainability. The transportation of food contributes to the increased use of fossil fuels, which in turn leads to global warming and climate change. By producing a larger portion of its food on-campus, Gettysburg College could reduce the amount of food transported to the school, thereby lessening the College’s environmental impact. Urban farming techniques, hydroponics, aquaponics, and greenhouse-based agriculture are explored as viable methods for achieving this goal. Examples of the use of these techniques on college campuses are drawn from Allegheny College, Acadia University, and Cornell University, among others. Possible strategies for Gettysburg College’s implementation of the farming techniques proposed in this research are also included throughout ArticleIn recent years, the recirculating aquaponics system has gained high attention and
significant popularity for organic vegetables and fruits production which contributes to the
sustainable aquaculture for tropical regions. This review aims to summarize the possibility for
practicing intercropping in aquaponics to produce high-quality fruits, vegetables and fish without
any chemical fertilizer and minimum ecological impact for a sustainable agriculture. Although
many studies have addressed about aquaponics for producing high-value crops such as tomato,
cucumber, and lettuce, there is still a lack of complete information to support the development of
intercropping in aquaponics and limited focus on its commercial implementation. Moreover, this
study will focus first on the requirements for inserting intercropping in aquaponics and technical
improvements needed to adapt as potential for sustainable food production system to increase
productivity around the world, especially in countries have deficiency in water and land resources
as well as soil problem like salinity and reduce environmental emissions. Secondly, the insertion
of intercropping in aquaponics must be for crops with high value and for crops that can
complement together such as tomato with basil and tomato with lettuce. Thirdly, in technical
improvement in this study will summarize the strategies and factors that affect the intercropping
in aquaponics system such as the nutrients needed for crops under intercropping aquaponics,
stocking density and feeding rate which are important to know the concentration of ammonia that
is produced and converted to nitrate so that the plants can uptake it. Studying the requirements
for inserting and improving intercropping in aquaponics will increase our understanding of
needed for new agriculture technique that contributes to the sustainable aquaponics for tropical
regions Aquaponics is a sustainable food production system that integrates hydroponics and aquaculture practices in order to attain optimum utilization of nutrients by re-cycling. Aquaponics facilitates the symbiotic production of vegetables and fishes with minimum inputs, organic farming like management and higher control on production. Aquaponics system is extremely water efficient, does not require soil and does not use fertilizers or chemical pesticides. Silver pompano Trachinotus blochii is a preferred candidate species for mariculture due to the availability of hatchery produced seed, adaptability to commercial pellet feeds, good market demand and excellent meat quality. The species has proven good for farming in both marine as well as low saline water bodies. Adopting the principles of nutrient utilization in aquaponics and the ability of silver pompano to grow in low saline conditions, a prototype of a low saline aquaponics system integrating one month reared fingerlings of silver pompano T. blochii, with a common, leafy vegetable Amaranthus by employing a 0.25 hp submersible pump for recirculation was developed Aquaponics is an emerging method of agriculture in which fish and plants are grown in an enclosed and recirculating environment. The method mimics a relationship found in nature where fish waste provides nutrients for plants and plants cleanse the water for the benefit of the fish. This symbiotic relationship has proven to be a sustainable method of agriculture in which there is less water use, no need for pesticides or herbicides, recycling of nutrient waste and a smaller spatial footprint. However, the production of both plants and fish in a recirculating aquaponics system has produced less yield and profit when compared to its competitive counterparts, hydroponics and RAS (recirculating aquaculture system) methods. To address this issue, the traditional single recirculation aquaponics system (SRAPS) has been reengineered to a decoupled recirculation aquaponics system (DRAPS). The main differences of the DRAPS system is 1) solid waste from fish is mineralized and sent to the hydroponic plant grow system; 2) water from hydroponic system does not return to the fish; and 3) separate aquatic environments for fish and plants allow for the caretaker to create ideal growing conditions based on the specific needs of the culture organism. The objective of this study was to compare the yield of lettuce, Lactuca sativa, against three systems, hydroponics, SRAPS and DRAPS. The results of this study suggest that aquaponic environments provide a more habitable environment for plants to thrive over comparable hydroponic environments. Further research must be done to refine DRAPS and create a sustainable agriculture system to feed a growing world with less resources"	['68527216', '5179777', '45458311', '60990245', '62528845', '77675571', '78775468', '17597775', '84392970']	[[{'name': 'Mohamed Abdelrahman, Ahmed Abdelrahman'}], [{'name': 'A Endut'}, {'name': 'A Manarangi'}, {'name': 'AA Al-Gheethi'}, {'name': 'AA Al-Gheethi'}, {'name': 'AR Rahmani'}, {'name': 'AW Mayo'}, {'name': 'B Holm'}, {'name': 'B Marques'}, {'name': 'CA Madera-Parra'}, {'name': 'CE Lim'}, {'name': 'CH Sim'}, {'name': 'CY Wang'}, {'name': 'E Noman'}, {'name': 'G Provolo'}, {'name': 'GH Bindu'}, {'name': 'H Huang'}, {'name': 'H Teiri'}, {'name': 'IW Witus'}, {'name': 'J Del-Pozo'}, {'name': 'J Popp'}, {'name': 'JL Catley'}, {'name': 'JP Fry'}, {'name': 'KM Buzby'}, {'name': 'L Dediu'}, {'name': 'L Silva'}, {'name': 'NM Apandi'}, {'name': 'NM Jais'}, {'name': 'PV Haseena'}, {'name': 'RA Criley'}, {'name': 'S Jasrotia'}, {'name': 'S Mishra'}, {'name': 'S Naidoo'}, {'name': 'S Rysgaard'}, {'name': 'S Wongkiew'}, {'name': 'SE Boxman'}, {'name': 'SN Nandeshwar'}, {'name': 'SO Ojoawo'}, {'name': 'SS Lam'}, {'name': 'VK Gupta'}, {'name': 'XW Chen'}, {'name': 'Y Xu'}, {'name': 'YY Fang'}, {'name': 'Z Hu'}], [{'name': 'Dos Santos, Maria José Palma Lampreia'}], [{'name': 'Birolo, M.'}, {'name': 'Borin, M.'}, {'name': 'Maucieri, C.'}, {'name': 'Nicoletto, C.'}, {'name': 'Sambo, P.'}, {'name': 'Trocino, A.'}, {'name': 'Xiccato, G.'}, {'name': 'Zanin, G.'}], [{'name': 'Oliver, Lauren'}, {'name': 'Whitworth, Cristina'}], [{'name': 'Werley, Bryn K.'}], [{'name': 'Al-Tawaha, A.M.'}, {'name': 'Puteri Edaroyati, M.W.'}, {'name': 'Siti Aishah, H.'}], [{'name': 'Asokan, P K'}, {'name': 'Imelda, Joseph'}, {'name': 'Shilta, M T'}, {'name': 'Suresh Babu, P P'}, {'name': 'Vinod, K'}], [{'name': 'Lucas, Haley Luise'}]]	['Effect of Feeding Frequency and Stocking Density on Tilapia Oreochromis Niloticus and Lettuce Lactuca Sativa Production in Aquaponics System under the UAE Condition and Business Enterprise Analysis', 'Bioﬁlter aquaponic system for nutrients removal from fresh market wastewater', 'Commercial aquaponics approaching the European market: a consumers’ perception on aquaponics products in Europe', 'Effect of stocking density of fish on water quality and growth performance of European Carp and leafy vegetables in a low-tech aquaponic system', 'Climate Smart Farming for Women in East Africa', 'Campus-Based Agriculture: The Future of Food at Gettysburg College', 'Requirements for inserting intercropping in aquaponics system for sustainability in agricultural production system', 'Low saline aquaponics system with Silver Pompano as a candidate species', 'Analysis of Plant Biomass Production Comparing Decoupled Aquaponics Against Equivalent Single-Loop Aquaponic and Hydroponic Systems Growing Lactuca Sativa']	9.0	exploratory	0.5

synchrotron template that we have recently developed, and between the template
and CMB temperature maps derived from WMAP data. Since the polarized
synchrotron template itself uses WMAP data, we can estimate residual
synchrotron contamination in the CMB $C_\ell^{TE}$ angular spectrum. While
$C_2^{TE}$ appears to be contamined by synchrotron, no evidence for
contamination is found in the multipole range which is most relevant for the
fit of the cosmological optical depth.Comment: Accepted for pubblication on MNRAS Lette We present analytic approximations to the optically thin synchrotron and
synchrotron self-Compton (SSC) spectra when Klein-Nishina (KN) effects are
important and pair production and external radiation fields can be neglected.
This theory is useful for analytical treatment of radiation from astrophysical
sources, such as gamma-ray bursts (GRBs), active galactic nuclei and pulsar
wind nebula, where KN effects may be important. We consider a source with a
continuous injection of relativistic electrons with a power-law energy
distribution above some typical injection energy. We find that the
synchrotron-SSC spectra can be described by a broken power-law, and provide
analytic estimates for the break frequencies and power-law indices. In general,
we show that the dependence of the KN cross-section on the energy of the
upscattering electron results in a hardening of the energy distribution of fast
cooling electrons and therefore in a hardening of the observed synchrotron
spectrum. As a result the synchrotron spectrum of fast cooling electrons, below
the typical injection energy, can be as hard as $F_\nu \propto \nu^0$, instead
of the classical $\nu^{-1/2}$ when KN effects are neglected. The synchrotron
energy output can be dominated by electrons with energy above the typical
injection energy. We solve self-consistently for the cooling frequency and find
that the transition between synchrotron and SSC cooling can result in a
discontinuous variations of the cooling frequency and the synchrotron and SSC
spectra. We demonstrate the application of our results to theory by applying
them to prompt and afterglow emission models of GRBs We investigate thermal synchrotron radiation at semi-relativistic and
relativistic temperatures. We find an analytic expression for the
angle-averaged emission coefficient, and show that it is significantly more
accurate that those derived previously. We also present analytic approximations
to the synchrotron turnover frequency. Then, we treat Comptonization of the
synchrotron radiation, and give simple expressions for the spectral shape and
the emitted power. We also consider modifications of the above results by
bremsstrahlung. The importance of Comptonization of synchrotron radiation in
compact X-ray sources is then studied. We consider emission from hot accretion
flows and from active coronae above optically-thick accretion discs in
black-hole binaries and AGNs. Synchrotron Comptonization is found to be, in
general, negligible in luminous sources, except for those with hardest X-ray
spectra and stellar masses. Increasing the black-hole mass results in a strong
reduction of the maximum Eddington ratio possible from to this process. X-ray
spectra of intermediate-luminosity sources, e.g., low-luminosity AGNs, can be
explained by synchrotron Comptonization only in the case of hot accretion
flows. Then, bremsstrahlung emission always dominates X-ray spectra of very
weak sources. Finally, we consider weakly-magnetized neutron stars and find
that synchrotron Comptonization can account for the power-law X-ray spectra
observed in their low states.Comment: 17 pages, 17 postscript figures. Accepted to MNRA (abr.) The spectral energy distribution (SED) of blazars typically has a
double-humped appearance usually interpreted in terms of synchrotron
self-Compton models. In proton blazar models, the SED is instead explained in
terms of acceleration of protons and subsequent cascading. We discuss a
variation of the Synchrotron Proton Blazar model, first proposed by M\""ucke &
Protheroe (1999), in which the low energy part of the SED is mainly synchrotron
radiation by electrons co-accelerated with protons which produce the high
energy part of the SED mainly asproton synchrotron radiation. Using a Monte
Carlo/numerical technique to simulate the interactions and subsequent cascading
of the accelerated protons, we are able to fit the observed SED of Markarian
501 during the April 1997 flare. We find that the emerging cascade spectra
initiated by gamma-rays from $\pi^0$ decay and by $e^\pm$ from $\mu^\pm$ decay
turn out to be relatively featureless. Synchrotron radiation produced by
$\mu^\pm$ from $\pi^\pm$ decay, and even more importantly by protons, and
subsequent synchrotron-pair cascading, is able to reproduce well the high
energy part of the SED. For this fit we find that synchrotron radiation by
protons dominates the TeV emission, pion photoproduction being less important
with the consequence that we predict a lower neutrino flux than in other proton
blazar models.Comment: 28 pages, 8 Figures, accepted for publication in Astropart.Phy The broadband SEDs of blazars exhibit two broad spectral components, which in
leptonic emission models are attributed to synchrotron radiation and
synchrotron self-Compton (SSC) radiation of relativistic electrons. During high
state phases, the high-frequency SSC component often dominates the
low-frequency synchrotron component, implying that the inverse Compton SSC
losses of electrons are at least equal to or greater than the synchrotron
losses of electrons. We calculate from the analytical solution of the kinetic
equation of relativistic electrons, subject to the combined linear synchrotron
and nonlinear synchrotron self-Compton cooling, for monoenergetic injection the
time-integrated total synchrotron and SSC radiation fluences and spectral
energy distributions (SED). Depending on the ratio of the initial cooling
terms, displayed by the injection parameter $\alpha$, we find for $\alpha\ll
1$, implying complete linear cooling, that the synchrotron peak dominates the
inverse Compton peak and the usual results of the spectra are recovered. For
$\alpha\gg 1$ the SSC peak dominates the synchrotron peak, proving our
assumption that in such a case the cooling becomes initially non-linear. The
spectra also show some unique features, which can be attributed directly to the
non-linear cooling. To show the potential of the model, we apply it to
outbursts of 3C 279 and 3C 454.3, successfully reproducing the SEDs. The
results of our analysis are promising, and we argue that this non-equilibrium
model should be considered in future modeling attempts for blazar flares.Comment: accepted by MNRAS, 32 pages (single column), 7 figure"	['844998', '637582', '872375', '809881', '783529']	"[[{'name': 'Bernardi, G.'}, {'name': 'Carretti, E.'}, {'name': 'Cortiglioni, S.'}, {'name': 'Fabbri, R.'}, {'name': 'Sbarra, C.'}], [{'name': 'Ando'}, {'name': 'Böttcher'}, {'name': 'Coppi'}, {'name': 'Derishev'}, {'name': 'Dermer'}, {'name': 'Ehud Nakar'}, {'name': 'Fan'}, {'name': 'Granot'}, {'name': 'Kaneko'}, {'name': 'Li'}, {'name': 'Lithwick'}, {'name': 'Mastichiadis'}, {'name': 'Meszaros'}, {'name': ""Pe'er""}, {'name': ""Pe'er""}, {'name': 'Petry'}, {'name': 'Preece'}, {'name': 'Preece'}, {'name': ""Re'em Sari""}, {'name': 'Rees'}, {'name': 'Sari'}, {'name': 'Sari'}, {'name': ""Shin'ichiro Ando""}, {'name': 'Tavecchio'}, {'name': 'Vurm'}, {'name': 'Zhang'}], [{'name': 'A.

Gereç ve Yöntemler: Retrospektif ve ta- nımlayıcı nitelikteki bu çalışmaya 48’i üstün zekâlı ve 46’sı kontrol olan 94 çocuk ve anne çifti dâhil edilmiştir. Demografik bilgiler, beslenme alışkan- lıkları ve fiziksel aktivite durumları anket formu ile sorgulanmıştır. Bulgu- lar: Üstün zekâ ve kontrol grubundaki çocukların yaş ortalamaları sırasıyla 9,3±1,9 ve 10,3±1,4 yıldır. Annelerin eğitim durumları arasında anlamlı fark görülmezken (p=0,125), meslek dağılımlarının anlamlı olarak farklı olduğu; kontrol grubu annelerinin %58,7’sinin ev hanımı, üstün zekâ grubu annele- rinin %47,9’unun memur veya özel sektör çal ışanı olduğu belirlenmiştir (p=0,035). Annenin gebelikteki fiziksel aktivite durumu ile çocu ğun üstün zekâlı olması arasında anlamlı bir ilişki bulunmamıştır (p=0,580). Gebelikte balık, çay, kahve ve su tüketimi; ya ğ tercihi, iyotlu/iyotsuz tuz kullan ımı gibi faktörler ve besin desteği kullanımı ile zekâ arasında anlamlı bir ilişki gözlenmemiştir (p>0,05). Gebelikte bir besine aşırı istek duyma oranı her iki grupta da benzer olup üstün zekâ grubunda besinlere kar şı tiksinti duyma oranı, kontrol grubuna göre anlaml ı olarak daha dü şük bulunmu ştur (p=0,039). En fazla istek duyulan besinler başta erik olmak üzere diğer mey- veler olurken en fazla tiksinti duyulan besinler tavuk, so ğan ve çay olarak kaydedilmiştir. Sonuç: Soyut bir kavram olan zekây ı etkileyen faktörlerin belirlenmesi oldukça karma şık ve zorlay ıcıdır. Annenin gebelikteki bes- lenme durumu ve alışkanlıklarının çocuğun zekâ düzeyi üzerindeki etkile- rini net olarak belirlemek için daha kapsaml ı, kontrollü ve uzun süreli çalışmalar gereklidir.Objective: In this study, it was aimed to investigate the nu- tritional habits of mothers with gifted children during pregnancy and to com- pare them with the control group. Material and Methods: This retrospective and descriptive study included 94 child and mother couples, 48 of whom were gifted and 46 of whom were controls. Demographic infor- mation, nutritional habits and physical activity status were questioned with a questionnaire. Results: The mean ages of the children in the gifted and control groups were 9.3±1.9 and 10.3±1.4 years, respectively. While there was no significant difference between the education levels of the mothers (p=0.125), the occupational distributions were significantly different; It was determined that 58.7% of the mothers of the control group were housewives, and 47.9% of the mothers of the gifted group were civil servants or private sector employees (p=0.035). There was no significant relationship between the physical activity status of the mother during pregnancy and the child being in the gifted group (p=0.580). No significant relationship was ob- served between factors such as fish, tea, coffee and water consumption; oil preference, use of iodized/non-iodized salt and the use of nutritional sup- plements during pregnancy and intelligence (p>0.05). The rate of excessive craving for any food during pregnancy was similar in both groups, and the rate of food disgust in the gifted group was found to be significantly lower than the control group (p=0.039). While the most desired foods were other fruits, especially plums, the most disgusting foods were recorded as chicken, onions and tea. Conclusion: Determining the factors affecting intelligence, which is an abstract concept, is quite complex and challenging. More com- prehensive, controlled and long-term studies are needed to more clearly de- termine the effects of the mother’s nutritional status and habits during pregnancy on the child’s intelligence level İçinde yaşadığımız modern zaman diliminde insanoğlu ile tabiat düzeni
arasında özellikle dikkat edilmesi gereken ciddi uyuşmazlıklar baş göstermiştir.
Modern zamanın bir bunalımı olarak tanımlayabileceğimiz bu sorunlar sosyal

Tabii düzenin bozulması, canlılar dünyası arasında kurulu olan ekolojik
dengenin kaybolması ve bunun sonucunda yaşadığımız dünyada göz ardı edilemez

bulunulmuş olsa da tabiatın doğal düzeni hala uyarılar vermeye devam etmektedir In this study, it was examined whether the anxiety and aggression observed in children were predicted by the irrational beliefs and anxieties of the parents, the marital conflict perceived by the children, automatic thoughts and problem solving skills. The study group is comprised of 304 elementary school fourth-grade students (170 females and 134 males) attending a state school located in the city of İzmir, Turkey, during the 2016-2017 academic school year. Additionally, the study group includes the students’ parents (n = 608), making a total of 912 participants. Within the context of the study, the “Trait Anxiety Scale” and “Parent Irrational Beliefs Scale” were administered to the parents, and the “Children’s Perception of Marital Conflict Scale,” “Problem Solving Inventory for Children,” “Children’s Automatic Thoughts Scale,” “Trait Anxiety Inventory for Children,” and “Little Aggression Scale” were administered to the students. The analyses conducted in the current study have revealed that except for the variables of father’s trait anxiety and mother’s irrational beliefs, the other variables have a significant contribution to the model; that father’s irrational beliefs, marital conflict perceived by children, children’s automatic thoughts and problem-solving skills significantly predicted anxiety in children, and that 55% of the total variance was explained. Moreover, the children’s problem-solving skills and automatic thoughts were found to explain 27% of the total variance in aggression in children. On the other hand, mother’s trait anxiety, father’s irrational beliefs, and perceived marital conflict were found to have no role in the prediction of children’s aggressive behaviors. The findings obtained as a result of the research are discussed according to the relevant literature within the scope of the Ecological Model, and suggestions are made for future research.Bu araştırmada, çocuklarda görülen kaygı ve saldırganlığın ebeveynlerin akılcı olmayan inançları, kaygıları, çocukların algıladığı evlilik çatışması, otomatik düşünceleri ve problem çözme becerileri tarafından yordanıp yordanmadığı incelenmiştir. Çalışma verileri, İzmir’de bir devlet ilkolunda 2016-2017 eğitim-öğretim döneminde 4. sınıfa devam eden 170’i kız 134’ü erkek toplam 304 öğrenci ve bu öğrencilerin 608 kişilik ebeveyn grubu olmak üzere toplam 912 kişiden elde edilmiştir. Çalışma kapsamında çocuklara; “Little Saldırganlık Envanteri”, “Çocuklar için Sürekli Kaygı Envanteri”, “Çocuklarda Otomatik Düşünceler Ölçeği”, “Çocuklar için Problem Çözme Envanteri” ve “Çocukların Evlilik Çatışmasını Algılaması Ölçeği” uygulanırken, ebeveynlere; “Sürekli Kaygı Envanteri” ve “Anne-Babaların Akılcı Olmayan İnançları Ölçeği” uygulanmıştır. Yapılan analizler sonucunda, çocukların otomatik düşünceleri ve problem çözme becerilerinin çocuklardaki saldırganlığı anlamlı derecede yordayarak toplam varyansın %27’sini açıkladığı, çocukların algıladığı evlilik çatışması, problem çözme becerileri ve otomatik düşünceleri ile babaların akılcı olmayan inançlarının ise çocuklardaki kaygıyı anlamlı biçimde yordadığı ve toplam varyansın %55’ini açıkladığı saptanmıştır. Ayrıca araştırma sonucunda annelerin sürekli kaygısı, babaların akılcı olmayan inançları ve algılanan evlilik çatışmasının çocuklardaki saldırgan davranışları anlamlı bir şekilde yordamadığı tespit edilmiştir. Araştırma bulguları Ekolojik Model kapsamında ilgili literatür doğrultusunda tartışılmış ve önerilerde bulunulmuştur The purpose of this study is to determine the factors that cause students drop out of school in secondary education.This is a descriptive survey study and the quantitative research method was employed. 2985 secondaryschool dropouts participated in the study and the data was collected through “Secondary School Dropout Questionnaire”.According to the findings, participants had to drop out because of financial problems, failure,absenteeism, enrolling to open education, family problems, disliking the school, having problems with teachersand administrators, studying for university entrance exam, health problems, marriage, the idea that attending theschool is unnecessary, migration, having to take care of parents in need, and disciplinary penalties. Based on thefindings, it is suggested that especially school administrators and teachers, all practitioners and decision-makersneed to give priority to school dropout problem. In addition, for student, teacher and administrators, curricularand extracurricular activities and programs to reduce school dropout should be prepared and put into practice Only teaching in schools is not enough for individuals with developmental disabilities for them to be independent in the society. For this reason, the present study has four purposes(a) Can the mothers implement simultaneous prompting reliably which was taught to them via visual supports?, (b)Can children with developmental disabilities acquire the target skills which were taught by their mothers?, (c) Can mothers and children with developmental disabilities maintain and generalize the acquired skills during the study?, and (d) What are the opinions of mothers regarding the teaching method and the study? In order to reach these purposes, a multiple probe design across participants was used in the study with four children and their mothers. After conducting the study at the homes of the participants, it was seen that mothers reliably implemented simultaneous prompting which was taught via a training CD, besides, children with developmental disabilities acquired the target skills which were taught by their mothers in the study.Gelişimsel yetersizliği olan bireylerin toplum içinde bağımsız yaşantılar sürdürebilmeleri için sadece okulda yapılan eğitim-öğretim yeterli olmamaktadır. Bu nedenle bu çalışmanın dört amacı bulunmaktadır: (a) Kendilerine CD aracılığıyla eşzamanlı ipucuyla öğretim yöntemi öğretilen anneler yöntemi güvenilir olarak kullanabilecekler mi?, (b) Gelişimsel yetersizliği olan çocuklar kendilerine öğretilen becerileri öğrenebilecekler mi?, (c) Çalışmaya katılan anneler ve çocukları öğrendikleri becerileri öğretim tamamlandıktan sonra da sürdürebilecekler ve genelleyebilecekler mi? ve (d) Çalışmaya katılan annelerin yönteme ve çalışmaya ilişkin görüşleri nedir? Bu amaçları gerçekleştirebilmek üzere deneklerarası yoklama evreli çoklu yoklama modeli kullanılarak dört anne ve çocuğuyla çalışılmıştır. Katılımcıların evlerinde gerçekleştirilen uygulamalar sonucunda annelerin kendilerine CD aracılığıyla öğretilen eşzamanlı ipucuyla öğretim yöntemini güvenilir bir biçimde uygulayabildikleri ve gelişimsel yetersizliği olan çocuklarının da annelerinin öğrettiği hedef becerileri öğrendikleri görülmüştür The purpose of this study is to analyze writing dispositions of 6th grade students in terms of different variables. In this research structured in survey model, “Writing Disposition Scale” developed by Piazza and Siebert (2008) and adapted to Turkish by İşeri and Ünal (2010) was used as the measurement tool. There are 21 articles in the 5 point likert type scale. Working group of the research consists of 436 students studying in a total of ten primary schools incentralŞarkışla county of Sivas province. According to the findings obtained from the research, there is no significant difference between writing dispositions of students and their parents’ level of education. However, it has been determined that writing dispositions of students differ significantly based on their gender, the number of books they read within the last month, and the status of diary keeping. Suggestions that would contribute to increasing students’ writing dispositionshave been made according to the research findings.Bu çalışmanın amacı, 6. sınıf öğrencilerinin yazma eğilimlerini farklı değişkenler açısından incelemektir. Tarama modelinde yapılandırılan bu araştırmada ölçme aracı olarak Piazza ve Siebert (2008) tarafından geliştirilen, İşeri ve Ünal (2010) tarafından Türkçeye uyarlanan “Yazma Eğilimi Ölçeği” kullanılmıştır. 5’li Likert tipindeki ölçekte 21 madde bulunmaktadır. Araştırmanın çalışma grubunu Sivas ili Şarkışla ilçe merkezindeki toplam on ilköğretim okulunda öğrenim gören 436 öğrenci oluşturmaktadır. Araştırmada elde edilen bulgulara göre öğrencilerin yazma eğilimleri ile anne ve babalarının eğitim düzeyi arasında anlamlı bir farklılık bulunmamaktadır. Ancak öğrencilerin yazma eğilimlerinin cinsiyetleri, son bir ay içerisinde okudukları kitap sayısı ve günlük tutma durumlarına göre anlamlı bir şekilde farklılaştığı tespit edilmiştir. Araştırma bulgularına göre öğrencilerin yazma eğilimlerinin artırılmasına katkı sağlayacak önerilerde bulunulmuştur Memlükler zamanında askeri ve sivil bürokrasi içinde kadına büyük değer verildiği, toplumda da kadına bakışın genelde olumlu olduğu görülmektedir. Bilhassa hadis ilminde olmak üzere dini ilimler alanında yüzlerce kadın alim yetişmiştir. Bu dönemde kadınlar, batılı seyyahların dikkatini çekecek ölçüde sosyal hayata iştirak etmişlerdir. Bu arada dul veya kocaları tarafından evden kovulan kadınların korunmasına yönelik müesseselerin bulunması da dikkat çekmektedir.In the period of Mamelukes, women, generally, was given great importance in the society as well as in the military and civil bureaucracy.

Influenza and Other Respiratory Viruses published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd.Background: Information on vaccine effectiveness in a context of novel variants of concern (VOC) emergence is of key importance to inform public health policies. This study aimed to estimate a measure of comparative vaccine effectiveness between Omicron (BA.1) and Delta (B.1.617.2 and sub-lineages) VOC according to vaccination exposure (primary or booster). Methods: We developed a case–case study using data on RT-PCR SARS-CoV-2-positive cases notified in Portugal during Weeks 49–51, 2021. To obtain measure of comparative vaccine effectiveness, we compared the odds of vaccination in Omicron cases versus Delta using logistic regression adjusted for age group, sex, region, week of diagnosis, and laboratory of origin. Results: Higher odds of vaccination were observed in cases infected by Omicron VOC compared with Delta VOC cases for both complete primary vaccination (odds ratio [OR] = 2.1; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.8 to 2.4) and booster dose (OR = 5.2; 95% CI: 3.1 to 8.8), equivalent to reduction of vaccine effectiveness from 44.7% and 92.8%, observed against infection with Delta, to −6.0% (95% CI: 29.2% to 12.7%) and 62.7% (95% CI: 35.7% to 77.9%), observed against infection with Omicron, for complete primary vaccination and booster dose, respectively. Conclusion: Consistent reduction in vaccine-induced protection against infection with Omicron was observed. Complete primary vaccination may not be protective against SARS-CoV-2 infection in regions where Omicron variant is dominant.publishersversionpublishe Funding Information: We would like to thank all the clinicians, health-care providers, and patient organisations who helped to develop and disseminate this survey.

Publisher Copyright: © 2021 Elsevier LtdBackground: The impact and consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic on people with rheumatic disease are unclear. We developed the COVID-19 Global Rheumatology Alliance Patient Experience Survey to assess the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on people with rheumatic disease worldwide. Methods: Survey questions were developed by key stakeholder groups and disseminated worldwide through social media, websites, and patient support organisations. Questions included demographics, rheumatic disease diagnosis, COVID-19 diagnosis, adoption of protective behaviours to mitigate COVID-19 exposure, medication access and changes, health-care access and communication with rheumatologists, and changes in employment or schooling. Adults age 18 years and older with inflammatory or autoimmune rheumatic diseases were eligible for inclusion. We included participants with and without a COVID-19 diagnosis. We excluded participants reporting only non-inflammatory rheumatic diseases such as fibromyalgia or osteoarthritis. Findings: 12 117 responses to the survey were received between April 3 and May 8, 2020, and of these, 10 407 respondents had included appropriate age data. We included complete responses from 9300 adults with rheumatic disease (mean age 46·1 years; 8375 [90·1%] women, 893 [9·6%] men, and 32 [0·3%] participants who identified as non-binary). 6273 (67·5%) of respondents identified as White, 1565 (16·8%) as Latin American, 198 (2·1%) as Black, 190 (2·0%) as Asian, and 42 (0·5%) as Native American or Aboriginal or First Nation. The most common rheumatic disease diagnoses included rheumatoid arthritis (3636 [39·1%] of 9300), systemic lupus erythematosus (2882 [31·0%]), and Sjögren's syndrome (1290 [13·9%]). Most respondents (6921 [82·0%] of 8441) continued their antirheumatic medications as prescribed. Almost all (9266 [99·7%] of 9297) respondents adopted protective behaviours to limit SARS-CoV-2 exposure. A change in employment status occurred in 2524 (27·1%) of 9300) of respondents, with a 13·6% decrease in the number in full-time employment (from 4066 to 3514). Interpretation: People with rheumatic disease maintained therapy and followed public health advice to mitigate the risks of COVID-19. Substantial employment status changes occurred, with potential implications for health-care access, medication affordability, mental health, and rheumatic disease activity.

Original Article  published on 08 July 2021 https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-021-03767-xThe COVID-19 pandemic continues to pose a major public health threat, especially in countries with low vaccination rates. To better understand the biological underpinnings of SARS-CoV-2 infection and COVID-19 severity, we formed the COVID-19 Host Genetics Initiative1. Here we present a genome-wide association study meta-analysis of up to 125,584 cases and over 2.5 million control individuals across 60 studies from 25 countries, adding 11 genome-wide significant loci compared with those previously identified2. Genes at new loci, including SFTPD, MUC5B and ACE2, reveal compelling insights regarding disease susceptibility and severity.

Here we present meta-analyses bringing together 60 studies from 25 countries (Fig. 1 and Supplementary Table 1) for three COVID-19-related phenotypes: (1) individuals critically ill with COVID-19 on the basis of requiring respiratory support in hospital or who died as a consequence of the disease (9,376 cases, of which 3,197 are new in this data release, and 1,776,645 control individuals); (2) individuals with moderate or severe COVID-19 defined as those hospitalized due to symptoms associated with the infection (25,027 cases, 11,386 new and 2,836,272 control individuals); and (3) all cases with reported SARS-CoV-2 infection regardless of symptoms (125,584 cases, 76,022 new and 2,575,347 control individuals). Most studies have reported results before the roll out of the COVID-19 vaccination campaign. An overview of the study design is provided in Supplementary Fig. 1. We found a total of 23 genome-wide significant loci (P < 5 × 10−8) of which 20 loci remain significant after correction for multiple testing (P < 1.67 × 10−8) to account for the number of phenotypes examined (Fig. 2, Supplementary Fig. 2 and Supplementary Table 2). We compared the effects of these loci between the previous2 and current analysis and found that only one locus did not replicate (rs72711165). All of the other loci showed the expected increase in statistical significance (Supplementary Fig. 3).Peer ReviewedBarcelona Supercomputing Center (BSC) authors: Marta Guindo-Martinez,  David Torrents, Josep Maria MercaderPostprint (author's final draft PostprintPeer reviewe These written responses were completed by Dorothea Jansen as part of Project 2020: A Collaborative Oral History.

There is a need to optimize allocation of treatment and resources in intensive care, as clinically established risk assessments such as SOFA and APACHE II scores show only limited performance for predicting the survival of severely ill COVID-19 patients. Additional tools are also needed to monitor treatment, including experimental therapies in clinical trials. Comprehensively capturing human physiology, we speculated that proteomics in combination with new data-driven analysis strategies could produce a new generation of prognostic discriminators. We studied two independent cohorts of patients with severe COVID-19 who required intensive care and invasive mechanical ventilation. SOFA score, Charlson comorbidity index, and APACHE II score showed limited performance in predicting the COVID-19 outcome. Instead, the quantification of 321 plasma protein groups at 349 timepoints in 50 critically ill patients receiving invasive mechanical ventilation revealed 14 proteins that showed trajectories different between survivors and non-survivors. A predictor trained on proteomic measurements obtained at the first time point at maximum treatment level (i.e. WHO grade 7), which was weeks before the outcome, achieved accurate classification of survivors (AUROC 0.81). We tested the established predictor on an independent validation cohort (AUROC 1.0). The majority of proteins with high relevance in the prediction model belong to the coagulation system and complement cascade. Our study demonstrates that plasma proteomics can give rise to prognostic predictors substantially outperforming current prognostic markers in intensive care.Peer reviewedFinal Published versio This interview was conducted by Stacy Steele with Chris Chandler as part of Project 2020: A Collaborative Oral History.

This chapter examines the opportunities and challenges posed by the use of AI in how humans express and enact their sexualities. It does so by focusing on three main issues. First, it considers the idea of digisexuality, which according to McArthur and Twist (2017) is the label that should be applied to those ‘whose primary sexual identity comes through the use of technology’, particularly through the use of robotics and AI. While agreeing that this phenomenon is worthy of greater scrutiny, the chapter questions whether it is necessary or socially desirable to see this as a new form of sexual identity. Second, it looks at the role that AI can play in facilitating human-to-human sexual contact, focusing in particular on the use of self-tracking and predictive analytics in optimising sexual and intimate behaviour. There are already a number of apps and services that promise to use AI to do this, but they pose a range of ethical risks that need to be addressed at both an individual and societal level. Finally, it considers the idea that a sophisticated form of AI could be an object of love. Can we be truly intimate with something that has been ‘programmed’ to love us? Contrary to the widely-held view, this chapter argues that this is indeed possible This policy brief developed by the European Expert Group on Sexuality Education provides an overview of key issues in sexuality education. It focuses primarily on sexuality education in Europe and Central Asia but is also relevant to countries outside of these regions We identify three trends in the recent sociology of sexuality. First, we examine how queer theory has influenced many sociologists whose empirical work observes sexuality in areas generally thought to be asexual. These sociologists also elaborate queer theory\u27s challenge to sexual dichotomizing and trace the workings of power through sexual categories. Second, we look at how sociologists bring sexuality into conversation with the black feminist notion of “intersectionality” by examining the nature and effects of sexuality among multiple and intersecting systems of identity and oppression. A third trend in the sociology of sexuality has been to explore the relationships between sexuality and political economy in light of recent market transformations. In examining these trends, we observe the influence of globalization studies and the contributions of sociologists to understanding the role of sexuality in global processes. We conclude with the contributions sociologists of sexuality make toward understanding other social processes and with the ongoing need to study sexuality itself Background: Communication on sexuality within the family has been considered a determinant factor for the sexual behaviour of young women, contributing to delaying sexual initiation. Taking into account that young women are increasingly exposed to sexualized messages, they need clear, trustful and open communication on sexuality more than ever. However, in Mozambique, communication about sexuality is hampered by strict social norms. This paper evaluates the case of an intervention aimed at reducing the generational barrier for talking about sexuality and to contribute to better communication within the family context. 
Methods: The intervention consisted of three weekly one-hour coached sessions in which female adults and young interacted about sexuality. Realist evaluation was used as a framework to assess context, mechanisms, and outcomes of the intervention. Interviews were conducted among 13 participants of the sessions. 
Result: The interaction sessions were positively appreciated by the participants and contributed to change norms and attitudes towards communication on sexuality within families. Recognition of similarities and awareness of differences were key in the mechanisms leading to these outcomes. This was reinforced by the use of visual materials and the atmosphere of respect and freedom of speech that characterized the interactions. Limiting factors were related to the long-standing taboo on sexuality and existing misconceptions on sexuality education and talks about sex. 
Conclusion: By elucidating mechanisms and contextual factors our study adds knowledge on strategies to improve transgenerational communication about sexuality Background: The occupational therapy profession needs a framework to guide understanding of the occupational nature of sexuality and intimacy, assessment, intervention design, and measurement of outcomes. This study aimed to define the occupational nature of sexuality and intimacy and develop a theoretical and occupation-based screen, in-depth self-assessment, and performance measure.
Method: The Occupational Performance Inventory of Sexuality and Intimacy (OPISI) was developed following DeVellis’s (2017) guidelines for scale development that involved mapping the construct, generating an item pool, determining the format for measurement, and reviewing the initial item pool.
Results: The Occupational Therapy Sexual Assessment Framework (OTSAF) was developed to define the occupational nature of sexuality and intimacy, depict how the theoretical constructs intertwine with the domain of occupational therapy, and guide scale development. The OPISI includes a self-screen, in-depth self-assessment, and an individualized measure to establish baseline performance and detect self-perceived change in ability, satisfaction, understanding, and confidence in skills and ability to improve occupational performance associated with sexuality and intimacy over time.
Conclusion: The OTSAF defines the occupational nature of sexuality and intimacy and informs the occupational therapy scope of practice. The OPISI includes theoretical and occupation-based tools to adequately screen, assess, and measure performance related to the complex occupational nature of sexuality and intimacy. Formal validation is needed prior to releasing the OPISI for clinical use Our conceptualization of sexuality is rooted in gender. Modern, western society defines sexuality as which genders one is and is not attracted to—often appearing as a binary between homosexuality and heterosexuality. Recently, however, queer theorists have begun to push against the idea of binary sexuality altogether.
The interplay between gender and sexuality additionally manifests in the history of literature. Because the two are so intimately intertwined, writing about sexuality necessitates writing about gender. Twenty-One Love Poems by Adrienne Rich and Rapture by Carol Ann Duffy are two poetry collections where, as lesbian poets, gender and sexuality play an important role. Both Twenty-One Love Poems and Rapture draw on the tradition of sonnet sequences, a tradition defined by strict structure and gendered power dynamics. As lesbians with female speaker-poets writing about other women, Rich and Duffy both include and subvert themes and tropes, highlighted by their playing with the prescribed structure. Viewing the collections through the lens of sonnet sequences provides an intriguing perspective for examining the depiction of gender and, by extension, sexuality"	['8870940', '31307238', '41665264', '8290162', '71794394', '76527519', '40094688']	[[{'name': 'Danaher, John'}], [{'name': 'European Expert Group on Sexuality Education, the'}, {'name': 'Michielsen, Kristien'}], [{'name': 'Gamson, Joshua'}, {'name': 'Moon, Dawne'}], [{'name': 'Arnaldo, Carlos'}, {'name': 'Decat, Peter'}, {'name': 'Frederico, Mónica'}, {'name': 'Michielsen, Kristien'}], [{'name': 'Christy, Davis'}, {'name': 'Faulkner, Tori'}, {'name': 'Hess, Pamela'}, {'name': 'Kaizer, Kandyse'}, {'name': 'LeMond, Kelsey'}, {'name': 'Otte, Kasey'}, {'name': 'Walker, Beth Ann'}], [{'name': 'Seiler-Garman, Robin'}]]	['Sexuality', 'Sexuality education : what is it?', 'The Sociology of Sexualities: Queer and Beyond', 'Adult and young women communication on sexuality : a pilot intervention in Maputo-Mozambique', 'Development of the Occupational Performance Inventory of Sexuality and Intimacy (OPISI): Phase One', 'Lesbian Love Sonnets: Adrienne Rich and Carol Ann Duffy']	7.0	navigational	0.8198360296441437

We used comparative analysis to investigate the origin of genomic imprinting in mammals. PEG10 (paternally expressed 10) is a retrotransposon-derived imprinted gene that has an essential role for the formation of the placenta of the mouse. Here, we show that an orthologue of PEG10 exists in another therian mammal, the marsupial tammar wallaby (Macropus eugenii), but not in a prototherian mammal, the egg-laying platypus (Ornithorhynchus anatinus), suggesting its close relationship to the origin of placentation in therian mammals. We have discovered a hitherto missing link of the imprinting mechanism between eutherians and marsupials because tammar PEG10 is the first example of a differentially methylated region (DMR) associated with genomic imprinting in marsupials. Surprisingly, the marsupial DMR was strictly limited to the 5′ region of PEG10, unlike the eutherian DMR, which covers the promoter regions of both PEG10 and the adjacent imprinted gene SGCE. These results not only demonstrate a common origin of the DMR-associated imprinting mechanism in therian mammals but provide the first demonstration that DMR-associated genomic imprinting in eutherians can originate from the repression of exogenous DNA sequences and/or retrotransposons by DNA methylation Metagenomics is increasingly used not just to show patterns of microbial diversity but also as a culture-independent method to detect individual organisms of intense clinical, epidemiological, conservation, forensic, or regulatory interest.

These discrete disease entities are often labelled as asthma endotypes. The discovery of different asthma subtypes has moved from subjective approaches in which putative phenotypes are assigned by experts to data-driven ones which incorporate machine learning. This review focuses on the methodological developments of one such machine learning technique-latent class analysis-and how it has contributed to distinguishing asthma and wheezing subtypes in childhood. It also gives a clinical perspective, presenting the findings of studies from the past 5 years that used this approach. The identification of true asthma endotypes may be a crucial step towards understanding their distinct pathophysiological mechanisms, which could ultimately lead to more precise prevention strategies, identification of novel therapeutic targets and the development of effective personalized therapies Helminth parasite infections are associated with a battery of immunomodulatory mechanisms, which impact all facets of the host immune response to ensure their persistence within the host. This broad-spectrum modulation of host immunity has intended and unintended consequences, both advantageous and disadvantageous. Thus the host may benefit from suppression of collateral damage during parasite infection, and from reduced allergic, autoimmune and inflammatory reactions. However, helminth infection can also be detrimental in reducing vaccine responses, increasing susceptibility to co-infection, and potentially reducing tumor immunosurveillance. In this review we will summarize the panoply of immunomodulatory mechanisms used by helminths, their potential utility in human disease, and prospective areas of future research Occupational asthma is the most common form of occupational lung disease in the developed world at the present time. In this review, the epidemiology, pathogenesis/mechanisms, clinical presentations, management, and prevention of occupational asthma are discussed. The population attributable risk of asthma due to occupational exposures is considerable. Current understanding of the mechanisms by which many agents cause occupational asthma is limited, especially for low-molecular-weight sensitizers and irritants. The diagnosis of occupational asthma is generally established on the basis of a suggestive history of a temporal association between exposure and the onset of symptoms and objective evidence that these symptoms are related to airflow limitation. Early diagnosis, elimination of exposure to the responsible agent, and early use of inhaled steroids may play important roles in the prevention of long-term persistence of asthma. Persistent occupational asthma is often associated with substantial disability and consequent impacts on income and quality of life. Prevention of new cases is the best approach to reducing the burden of asthma attributable to occupational exposures.

Josephson current through a gated interacting quantum dot. We analyze our
expression for two different models of the superconductor-dot-superconductor

voltage and Coulomb interaction. In the diffusive dot limit, we compute the
probability distribution P(J_c) of Josephson couplings. In both cases, pi
junction behavior (J_c < 0) is possible, and is not simply dependent on the

metal-insulator transition in two dimensions with emphasis on the continuous
connection between the zero-magnetic-field transition and the quantum Hall
transition. In this model the system consists of puddles connected via saddle
points, and there is loss of quantum coherence inside the puddles. The
effective conductance of the network is calculated using appropriate
integration over the distribution of conductances, leading to a determination
of the magnetic field dependence of the critical density. Excellent
quantitative agreement is obtained with the experimental data, which allows an
estimate of the puddle physical parameters A study was conducted to assess the feasibility of quasi-hybrid solid rocket boosters for advanced Earth-to-orbit vehicles. Thermochemical calculations were conducted to determine the effect of liquid hydrogen addition, solids composition change plus liquid hydrogen addition, and the addition of an aluminum/liquid hydrogen slurry on the theoretical performance of a PBAN solid propellant rocket. The space shuttle solid rocket booster was used as a reference point. All three quasi-hybrid systems theoretically offer higher specific impulse when compared with the space shuttle solid rocket boosters. However, based on operational and safety considerations, the quasi-hybrid rocket is not a practical choice for near-term Earth-to-orbit booster applications. Safety and technology issues pertinent to quasi-hybrid rocket systems are discussed When an atomic-size break junction is mechanically stretched, the total
conductance of the contact remains approximately constant over a wide range of
elongations, although at the same time the transmissions of the individual
channels (valence orbitals of the junction atom) undergo strong variations. We
propose a microscopic explanation of this phenomenon, based on Coulomb
correlation effects between electrons in valence orbitals of the junction atom.
The resulting approximate conductance quantization is closely related to the
Friedel sum rule.Comment: 4 pages, 1 figure, appears in Proceedings of the NATO Advanced

  28 - June 1, 200 An examination of the effects of surface step excrescences on boundary layer transition was performed, using a unique experimental facility. The objective of the work was to characterize the variation of transition Reynolds numbers with measurable step size and boundary layer parameters, with the specific goal of specifying new tolerance criteria for laminar flow airfoils, alongside a fundamental investigation of boundary layer transition mechanisms. This paper focuses on interpretation of hot-wire measurements, including supporting stability calculations, undertaken as part of the study. The results for both forward and aft-facing steps indicated a substantial stabilizing effect of favorable pressure gradient on excrescence-induced boundary layer transition. These findings suggest that manufacturing tolerances for laminar flow aircraft could be loosened in areas where even mild favorable pressure gradients exist We present a novel and convenient mean-field method, and apply it to study
the metallic/antiferromagnetic interface of k-(BEDT-TTF)_2Cu[N(CN)]_2 Y organic
superconductors (BEDT_TTF is bis-ethylen-dithio-tetrathiafulvalene, Y=Cl, Br).
The method, which fully exploits the crystal symmetry, allows one to obtain the
mean-field solution of the 2D Hubbard model for very large lattices, up to
6x10^5 sites, yielding a reliable description of the phase boundary in a wide
region of the parameter space. The metal/antiferromagnet transtion appears to
be second order, except for a narrow region of the parameter space, where the
transition is very sharp and possibly first order. The cohexistence of metallic
and antiferromagnetic properties is only observed for the transient state in
the case of smooth second order transitions. The relevance of the present
resaults to the complex experimental behavior of centrosymmetric k-phase
BEDT-TTF salts is discussed.Comment: 9 pages in PS format, 7 figures (included in PS), 1 tabl This paper deals with flight test activities performed on P2006T, a twin-engine light aircraft recently designed and produced by Tecnam. Research activities and flight tests have been conducted during the flight certification of P2006T for the normal category under CS-23. All the acquired data and flight results presented have been focused on both aircraft certification and on aircraft performances, stability and flight qualities measurement. The data have been acquired through a light, accurate and reliable flight instrumentation available at DIAS (Department of Aerospace Engineering). Some flight data about aircraft leveled speed, stall speed, climb characteristics and ground performances (take-off and landing) will be presented. After preliminary flight tests, winglets have been designed and added to the final configuration in order to obtain good climb performances also in OEI (One Engine Inoperative) conditions. Accurate stall tests have been performed in all configurations and influence of both entry-rate and load factor on stall speed have been highlighted. Excellent ground performances have been measured with short take-off and landing distances compared with similar airplanes. All measured flight performances can be considered very good for this aircraft category and have been used to demonstrate aircraft safety and to obtain CS23 certification"	['1255965', '1254951', '24880587', '1254940', '19698936', '1255586', '30773739']	[[{'name': 'Cambel A.

e003133a-b719-4eb0-b185-cf6015ff9fe6	metabolism	"The circadian system orchestrates metabolism in daily 24-hour cycles. Such rhythms organize metabolism by temporally separating opposing metabolic processes and by anticipating recurring feeding-fasting cycles to increase metabolic efficiency. Although animal studies demonstrate that the circadian system plays a pervasive role in regulating metabolism, it is unclear how, and to what degree, circadian research in rodents translates into humans. Here, we review evidence that the circadian system regulates glucose, lipid, and energy metabolism in humans. Using a range of experimental protocols, studies in humans report circadian rhythms in glucose, insulin, glucose tolerance, lipid levels, energy expenditure, and appetite. Several of these rhythms peak in the biological morning or around noon, implicating earlier in the daytime is optimal for food intake. Importantly, disruptions in these rhythms impair metabolism and influence the pathogenesis of metabolic diseases. We therefore also review evidence that circadian misalignment induced by mistimed light exposure, sleep, or food intake adversely affects metabolic health in humans. These interconnections among the circadian system, metabolism, and behavior underscore the importance of chronobiology for preventing and treating type 2 diabetes, obesity, and hyperlipidemia Metabolism displays striking and robust regularities in the forms of
modularity and hierarchy, whose composition may be compactly described. This
renders metabolic architecture comprehensible as a system, and suggests the
order in which layers of that system emerged. Metabolism also serves as the
foundation in other hierarchies, at least up to cellular integration including
bioenergetics and molecular replication, and trophic ecology. The
recapitulation of patterns first seen in metabolism, in these higher levels,
suggests metabolism as a source of causation or constraint on many forms of
organization in the biosphere.
  We identify as modules widely reused subsets of chemicals, reactions, or
functions, each with a conserved internal structure. At the small molecule
substrate level, module boundaries are generally associated with the most
complex reaction mechanisms and the most conserved enzymes. Cofactors form a
structurally and functionally distinctive control layer over the small-molecule
substrate. Complex cofactors are often used at module boundaries of the
substrate level, while simpler ones participate in widely used reactions.
Cofactor functions thus act as ""keys"" that incorporate classes of organic
reactions within biochemistry.
  The same modules that organize the compositional diversity of metabolism are
argued to have governed long-term evolution. Early evolution of core
metabolism, especially carbon-fixation, appears to have required few
innovations among a small number of conserved modules, to produce adaptations
to simple biogeochemical changes of environment. We demonstrate these features
of metabolism at several levels of hierarchy, beginning with the small-molecule
substrate and network architecture, continuing with cofactors and key conserved
reactions, and culminating in the aggregation of multiple diverse physical and
biochemical processes in cells.Comment: 56 pages, 28 figure Indexación: Scielo; Web of Science.In primary producers, diverse stressors cause an over-production of methylglyoxal (MG), which is principally detoxified by glyoxalase I (GLO1) activity. A recent proteomic study found that GLO1 was up-regulated during natural desiccation in the red seaweed Pyropia orbicularis, which inhabits the upper intertidal rocky zone and compared to other species, is highly tolerant to air exposure. To better understand and determine differential responses to desiccation stress, this study evaluated MG concentration and GLO1 activity in two species with contrasted vertical distribution, P. orbicularis and Lessonia spicata (lower distribution). Results showed that P. orbicularis successfully scavenges MG via increased GLO1 activity during desiccation. In contrast, GLO1 activity in L. spicata did not increase during desiccation, resulting in MG overproduction. This study is the first to quantify MG and GLO1 levels in seaweeds during natural stress, and partly explain the mechanisms by which P. orbicularis is dominant in the upper rocky intertidal zone.http://ref.scielo.org/tp4sn Listado

 Abstract Relations among nutrients affect the plant nutrition, promoting growth and yield of crops. Therefore, this study aimed to determine the influence of the relationships among foliar nutrients on the yield of four clones of fine cocoa (Theobroma cacao L., two clones self-incompatible, TSH-565 and ICS-39, and two self-compatible, CCN51and ICS-95. Different doses of fertilization were applied to determine which one of this nutrient ratio affect more the yield. A complete randomized block design with five treatments and four replications was used; CT (control), treatments T1, T2, T3 and T4 successively showed increments of NPK, respectively of 25%, 50%, 75% and 100% . Results showed differences in nutrient concentration in leaf under the clone influence , treatment and interaction clone treatment; the clone effect on P, Mg2+, B, Mn2+ and Zn2+; the treatment effect in all nutrients and interaction effect clone*treatment in N, P, Mg2+, B, Fe2+, Mn2+ and Zn2+; this indicates that the applied fertilizer levels influencing the availability and absorption of nutrients. Overall all clones had affinity for Mg2+, S2+and P; in different order of preference for N, K+, Ca2+ and the minor elements for Mn2+, Fe2+, Zn2+, Na+, B and Cu2+, except TSH-565. From the sixty six relationship among nutrients studied at the foliar level, it was found that the relationships among nutrients that showed better association to the yield were: N/Mg, N/P, N/S, N/K, the first two had positive effect and the remainder showed negative effect on yield. Keywords: Clone self-incompatible, clone self-compatible, fertilization, plant nutrition, Theobroma cacao. Resumen Las relaciones entre nutrientes afectan la nutrición de las plantas, favoreciendo el crecimiento y el rendimiento. Esta investigación tuvo como objetivo determinar la influencia de las relaciones entre nutrientes a nivel foliar, sobre el rendimiento de cuatro clones de cacao fino (Theobroma cacao L.), dos clones autoincompatibles, TSH-565-ICS-39, y dos autocompatibles, CCN-51-ICS-95. Se aplicaron diferentes dosis de fertilización para determinar cuál de estas relaciones afecta más el rendimiento, para ello se utilizó un diseño en bloques completos al azar con cinco tratamientos (TC (control), T1, T2, T3, y T4) consistentes en incrementos sucesivos de NPK, respectivamente de 25%, 50%, 75% y 100% sobre el tratamiento control (TC) y cuatro repeticiones. Los resultados muestran diferencias en la concentración de nutrientes a nivel foliar por influencia del clon, tratamiento e interacción clon*tratamiento; por efecto del clon en P, Mg 2+ , B, Mn 2+ y Zn 2+ ; por efecto del tratamiento en todos los nutrientes y por efecto de la interacción clon*tratamiento en N, P, Mg 2+ , B, Fe 2, Mn 2+ y Zn 2+ ; lo cual indica que los niveles de fertilización aplicados influyen en la disponibilidad y absorción de nutrientes. En general todos los clones presentan afinidad por Mg 2+ , S, P; en diferente orden de preferencia por N, K + , Ca 2+ y en los elementos menores, por Mn 2+ , Fe 2+ , Zn 2+ , Na + , B y Cu 2+ . De las sesenta y seis relaciones entre nutrientes estudiadas a nivel foliar, se encontró que las relaciones que más se asocian con el rendimiento son: N/Mg, N/P, N/S, N/K; las primeras dos tienen efecto positivo y el resto efecto negativo sobre el rendimiento. Palabras clave: Clon autoincompatible, clon autocompatible, fertilización, nutrición de plantas, Theobroma cacao A coating comprising quaternary ammonium salts (QAS) and aliphatic moieties was formed on the poly(vinyl chloride) (PVC) surface in order to confer antibacterial activity. This was achieved by grafting mercaptopropyltrimethoxysilane onto PVC, followed by aminopropyltriethoxysilane. Betaine and dodecenyl succinic anhydride (DDSA) were bonded to free amine groups. The modified PVC samples were characterized by FT-IR, showing that the PVC surface was successfully coated. Energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy showed the spatial distributions of the elements Si and S, indicating that the coatings were homogeneous. Betaine and DDSA coated PVC showed a better antibacterial performance than the controls. This antibacterial effect was extremely reinforced in betaine-DDSA modified PVC showing greater antibacterial activity than both treatments separately applied. Antibacterial activity against Acinetobacter baumannii, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus, and Bacillus subtilis was studied in the treated samples showing that the coating was effective against Gram positive and Gram negative species.Fil: Villanueva, María Emilia.

Instituto de Química y Metabolismo del Fármaco; Argentin Osteoarticular brucellosis is the most common presentation of human active disease although its prevalence varies widely. The three most common forms of osteoarticular involvement are sacroiliitis, spondylitis, and peripheral arthritis. The molecular mechanisms implicated in bone damage have been recently elucidated. B. abortus induces bone damage through diverse mechanisms in which TNF-α and the receptor activator of nuclear factor kappa-B ligand (RANKL)-the natural modulator of bone homeostasis are involved. These processes are driven by inflammatory cells, like monocytes/macrophages, neutrophils, Th17 CD4+ T, and B cells. In addition, Brucella abortus has a direct effect on osteoarticular cells and tilts homeostatic bone remodeling. These bacteria inhibit bone matrix deposition by osteoblasts (the only bone cells involved in bone deposition), and modify the phenotype of these cells to produce matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) and cytokine secretion, contributing to bone matrix degradation. B. abortus also affects osteoclasts (cells naturally involved in bone resorption) by inducing an increase in osteoclastogenesis and osteoclast activation; thus, increasing mineral and organic bone matrix resorption, contributing to bone damage. Given that the pathology induced by Brucella species involved joint tissue, experiments conducted on synoviocytes revealed that besides inducing the activation of these cells to secrete chemokines, proinflammatory cytokines and MMPS, the infection also inhibits synoviocyte apoptosis. Brucella is an intracellular bacterium that replicates preferentially in the endoplasmic reticulum of macrophages. The analysis of B. abortus-infected synoviocytes indicated that bacteria also replicate in their reticulum suggesting that they could use this cell type for intracellular replication during the osteoarticular localization of the disease. Finally, the molecular mechanisms of osteoarticular brucellosis discovered recently shed light on how the interaction between B. abortus and immune and osteoarticular cells may play an important role in producing damage in joint and bone.Fil: Giambartolomei, Guillermo Hernan.

 With the aim to produce mucoadhesive polymeric micelles for drug administration by mucosal routes, chitosan-g-oligo(epsilon-caprolactone) copolymers were synthesized by the microwave-assisted ring-opening polymerization of epsilon-caprolactone using chitosan as the macroinitiator and methanesulfonic acid as the solvent, catalyst and protecting group of the amine moieties. The reaction was conducted under very mild conditions and was completed within 10 min with a monomer conversion above 90%. The grafting of oligo(epsilon-caprolactone) blocks to the free hydroxyl groups of chitosan was confirmed by ATR/FT-IR, 1H- and 13C-NMR, WAXD and thermal analysis (TGA/DSC). The molecular weight of the synthetic hybrid copolymers was determined by GPC and MALDI-ToF mass spectrometry. Polymeric micelles obtained by the solvent diffusion/evaporation method showed a spherical shape (TEM and AFM) with sizes between 111 and 154 nm and highly positive zeta potential (>+50 mV) (DLS). In addition, they displayed good cell compatibility in the human lung adenocarcinoma epithelial line, A549, and were readily up-taken by the cervical cancer cell line, HeLa. Results from the encapsulation of the antituberculosis drug, rifampicin, showed that the micelles had better performance than other nanocarriers previously investigated (e.g., cyclodextrins). Moreover, the micelles conserved the mucoadhesiveness displayed by pristine chitosan and are expected to transiently open tight cell junctions and lead to more prolonged residence times in mucosal tissues and greater drug bioavailability.Fil: Glisoni, Romina Julieta.

• Estrategias comportamentales para mejorar la adherencia al tratamiento a largo plazo de la obesidad.     Stella Guerrero Duque


• Fisiología del colesterol y el papel de la PCSK9.     Alejandro Román Gonzále Objective:The incretin hormone glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) and its analogs, including the glucagonlike peptide 1 receptor agonist liraglutide, use a simple once-daily regimen and can be easily introduced in the outpatient setting. We compared treatment with liraglutide monotherapy and dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitor monotherapy in patients with untreated type 2 diabetes( T2DM).Methods:This study included 40 outpatients with untreated T2DM who were randomized to receive liraglutide (0.9 mg/day, n=24) or DPP-4 inhibitors (n=16:sitagliptin, 50 mg/day) as initial treatment for 6 months. Glycemic control, urinalysis, blood pressure, body weight, lipid levels, vascular endothelial function, and inflammatory factors were assessed before and after treatment.Results:Significant improvement was observed in HbA1c and fasting blood glucose levels after treatment in both groups;improvements in the liraglutide group were significantly better than in the sitagliptin group. Only the liraglutide group demonstrated significant improvements in blood pressure, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels, urinary albumin excretion, flow-mediated dilatation, and high-sensitivity C-reactive protein levels. Linear regression analysis demonstrated a significant negative relation between change in flow-mediated dilatation and high-sensitivity C-reactive protein levels.Conclusion:Liraglutide provided significant glycemic control and improved blood pressure, lipid levels, endothelial function, and inflammatory factors in untreated T2DM. In addition to its impact on blood glucose levels, liraglutide may have beneficial effects on the cardiovascular system in patients with T2DM Smart or stimuli-responsive materials are an emerging class of materials used for tissue engineering and drug delivery. A variety of stimuli (including temperature, pH, redox-state, light, and magnet fields) are being investigated for their potential to change a material’s properties, interactions, structure, and/or dimensions. The specificity of stimuli response, and ability to respond to endogenous cues inherently present in living systems provide possibilities to develop novel tissue engineering and drug delivery strategies (for example materials composed of stimuli responsive polymers that self-assemble or undergo phase transitions or morphology transformations). Herein, smart materials as controlled drug release vehicles for tissue engineering are described, highlighting their potential for the delivery of precise quantities of drugs at specific locations and times promoting the controlled repair or remodeling of tissues.Fil: Municoy, Sofia.

Instituto de Química y Metabolismo del Fármaco; Argentin Perilipin 2, also known as Adipose differentiation-relation protein or PLIN2, is a lipid droplet-binding protein present in almost every tissue. The absence of PLIN2 upregulates hepatic very low-density lipoprotein secretion, relieves hepatosteatosis, and improves whole body insulin resistance in mice. Despite of the importance in mediating lipid metabolism, the regulation of PLIN2 itself remains largely unknown. Previous reports have shown that X-box binding protein 1 (XBP1) is an important regulator of lipogenesis. XBP1 is a transcription factor that recognizes and binds to a consensus sequence, 5’-TGACGTGG-3’. Interestingly, when we looked through the promoter region of mouse Plin2 gene, we found that the consensus sequence is present in the Plin2 promoter. Therefore, we hypothesize that XBP1 might directly bind to Plin2 promoter and regulate the Plin2 expression.
To test our hypothesis, we will perform the luciferase assay to examine whether the Plin2 promoter activity is regulated by XBP1. We first designed forward and reverse PCR primers, which include BglII and BamHI restriction enzyme sites respectively, to amplify the Plin2 promoter region (from -1100 to +40). We performed PCR and cloned the Plin2 promoter to a TA vector. The TA vector was then sequenced to exclude any point mutations. After sequencing, we sub cloned the Plin2 promoter into a vector containing a luciferase reporter. In the future, we will transfect 293T, a human embryonic kidney cell line, with the Plin2 promoter-luciferase vector we generated. We will compare the Plin2 promoter activity by measuring the luminescence in the presence or absence of XBP1"	['54943850', '4213944', '38989266', '146411747', '100794381', '41008822', '40928244',

The impact extended to their social life and ability to form close relationships, and has implications for holistic practice. Presented at Association for European Paediatric Cardiology conference in Munich The medical field is creating large amount of data that physicians are unable
to decipher and use efficiently. Moreover, rule-based expert systems are
inefficient in solving complicated medical tasks or for creating insights using
big data. Deep learning has emerged as a more accurate and effective technology
in a wide range of medical problems such as diagnosis, prediction and
intervention. Deep learning is a representation learning method that consists
of layers that transform the data non-linearly, thus, revealing hierarchical
relationships and structures. In this review we survey deep learning
application papers that use structured data, signal and imaging modalities from
cardiology. We discuss the advantages and limitations of applying deep learning
in cardiology that also apply in medicine in general, while proposing certain
directions as the most viable for clinical use.Comment: 27 pages, 2 figures, 10 table For patients admitted with worsening heart failure, early follow-up after discharge is recommended. Whether outcomes can be improved when follow-up is done by cardiologists is uncertain. We aimed to determine the association between cardiology follow-up and risk of death for patients with heart failure discharged from hospital. Using data from the National Heart Failure Audit (England &amp; Wales), we investigated the effect of referral to cardiology follow-up on 30-day and one-year mortality in 68 772 patients with heart failure and a reduced left ventricular ejection fraction (HFREF) discharged from 185 hospitals between 2007 to 2013. The primary analyses used instrumental variable analysis complemented by hierarchical logistic and propensity matched models. At the hospital level, rates of referral to cardiologists varied from 6% to 96%. The median odds ratio (OR) for referral to cardiologist was 2.3 (95% confidence interval [CI] 2.1, 2.5), suggesting that, on average, the odds of a patient being referred for cardiologist follow-up after discharge differed approximately 2.3 times from one randomly selected hospital to another one. Based on the proportion of patients (per region) referred for cardiology follow-up, referral for cardiology follow-up was associated with lower 30-day (OR 0.70; CI 0.55, 0.89) and one-year mortality (OR 0.81; CI 0.68, 0.95) compared with no plans for cardiology follow-up (i.e., standard follow-up done by family doctors). Results from hierarchical logistic models and propensity matched models were consistent (30-day mortality OR 0.66; CI 0.61, 0.72 and 0.66; CI 0.58, 0.76 for hierarchical and propensity matched models, respectively). For patients with HFREF admitted to hospital with worsening symptoms, referral to cardiology services for follow-up after discharge is strongly associated with reduced mortality, both early and late 博士(医学) 甲第690号(主論文の要旨、要約、審査結果の要旨、本文)，著者名:Umiko ISHIZAKI・Michinobu NAGANO・Yumi SHIINA・Kei INAI・Hiroki MORI・Tatsunori TAKAHASHI・Shuji SAKAI，タイトル:Global strain and dyssynchrony of the single ventricle predict adverse cardiac events after the Fontan procedure: Analysis using feature-tracking cine magnetic resonance imaging，掲載誌:Journal of cardiology(0914-5087)，巻・頁・年:73巻2号 p.163-170(2019)，著作権関連情報:© 2018 Japanese College of Cardiology.

The objective of this study was to report the creation of metrics for patients with Kawasaki disease. Over a period of 5 months, 12 pediatric cardiologists developed 24 quality metrics based on the most relevant statements, guidelines, and research studies pertaining to Kawasaki disease. Of the 24 metrics, the 8 metrics deemed the most important, feasible, and valid were sent on to the ACPC for consideration. Seven of the 8 metrics were approved using the RAND method by an expert panel. All 7 metrics approved by the ACPC council were accepted by ACPC membership after an ""open comments"" process. They have been disseminated to the pediatric cardiology community for implementation by the ACPC Quality Network © Published by the BMJ Publishing Group Limited.Objectives To describe hospital inpatient, emergency department (ED) and outpatient department (OPD) activity for patients in the year following their first emergency admission for heart failure (HF). To assess the proportion receiving specialist assessment within 2â €...weeks of hospital discharge, as now recommended by guidelines. Design Observational study of national administrative data. Setting All acute NHS hospitals in England. Participants 82â €...241 patients with an index emergency admission between April 2009 and March 2011 with a primary diagnosis of HF. Main outcome measures Cardiology OPD appointment within 2â €...weeks and within a year of discharge from the index admission; emergency department (ED) and inpatient use within a year. Results 15.1% died during the admission. Of the 69â €...848 survivors, 19.7% were readmitted within 30â €...days and half within a year, the majority for non-HF diagnoses. 6.7% returned to the ED within a week of discharge, of whom the majority (77.6%) were admitted. The two most common OPD specialties during the year were cardiology (24.7% of the total appointments) and anticoagulant services (12.5%). Although half of all patients had a cardiology appointment within a year, the proportion within the recommended 2â €...weeks of discharge was just 6.8% overall and varied by age, from 2.4% in those aged 90+ to 19.6% in those aged 18-45 (p<0.0001); appointments in other specialties made up only some of the shortfall. More comorbidity at any age was associated with higher rates of cardiology OPD follow-up. Conclusions Patients with HF are high users of hospital services. Postdischarge cardiology OPD follow-up rates fell well below current National Institute for Health and Care Excellence guidelines, particularly for the elderly and those with less comorbidity Published on behalf of the European Society of Cardiology.

The awarding of appropriate damages to a person leading a part-subsistence village lifestyle presents the Courts with a special challenge.
This article considers the attempts that the Courts in Papua New Guinea have made to award appropriate damages to people living this lifestyle. The article attempts to bring together the common principles that emerge through the cases. It also outlines some of the important issues that still need to be addressed by the Courts to ensure that the actual needs of plaintiffs living in a village lifestyle are addressed An anniversary issue of Ariadne commissioned articles to predict the landscape ten years ahead. This contribution concludes that Open Access is a battleground where a ragamuffin band of academics and librarians are challenging the imperial pomp of billion dollar global companies. In those terms the contest is both unequal and unwinnable, since too much inertia is built into the system. However, as the article tries to show there are powerful drivers and change agents in place - technology; the nature of research; Google; national interest - which coupled with the sheer bloody-mindedness and persistence of the proponents of open access will lead to its growth as the dominant form of scholarly discourse.

We use EPPA to assess the human health damages (including acute mortality and morbidity outcomes) caused by ozone pollution and quantify their economic impacts in sixteen world regions. We compare the costs of ozone pollution under scenarios with 2000 and 2050 ozone precursor and greenhouse gas emissions (SRES A1B scenario). We estimate that health costs due to global ozone pollution above pre-industrial levels by 2050 will be $580 billion (year 2000$) and that acute mortalities will exceed 2 million. We find that previous methodologies underestimate costs of air pollution by more than a third because they do not take into account the long-term, compounding effects of health costs. The economic effects of emissions changes far exceed the influence of climate alone.United States Department of Energy, Office of

During the campaign, observed aromatic species onboard the NASA DC-8 aircraft, especially toluene, showed high mixing ratios of up to 10 ppbv, emphasizing the importance of aromatic chemistry in O3 production. To examine the role of VOCs and NOx in O3 chemistry, we first implement a detailed aromatic chemistry scheme in the model, which reduces the normalized mean bias of simulated O3 mixing ratios from –26% to –13%. Aromatic chemistry also increases the average net O3 production in Korea by 37%. Corrections of daytime PBL heights, which are overestimated in the model compared to lidar observations, increase the net O3 production rate by ~10%. In addition, increasing NOx emissions by 50% in the model shows best performance in reproducing O3 production characteristics, which implies that NOx emissions are underestimated in the current emissions inventory. Sensitivity tests show that a 30% decrease in anthropogenic NOx emissions in Korea increases the O3 production efficiency throughout the country, making rural regions ~2 times more efficient in producing O3 per NOx consumed. Simulated O3 levels overall decrease in the peninsula except for urban and other industrial areas, with the largest increase (~6 ppbv) in the Seoul Metropolitan Area (SMA). However, with simultaneous reductions in both NOx and VOCs emissions by 30%, O3 decreases in most of the country, including the SMA. This implies the importance of concurrent emission reductions for both NOx and VOCs in order to effectively reduce O3 levels in Korea"	['2104621', '78115563']	[[{'name': ''}, {'name': 'Bell M L'}, {'name': 'Bickel P'}, {'name': 'Center for International Earth Science Information Network (CIESIN)'}, {'name': 'Ebi K L'}, {'name': 'Heston A Summers R Aten B'}, {'name': 'Holland M'}, {'name': 'Holland M'}, {'name': 'J M Reilly'}, {'name': 'K M Nam'}, {'name': 'Knowlton K'}, {'name': 'M D Webster'}, {'name': 'Matus K'}, {'name': 'Mayeres I'}, {'name': 'Mickley L J'}, {'name': 'N E Selin'}, {'name': 'Nam K-M Selin N E Reilly J M Paltsev S'}, {'name': 'Paltsev S Reilly J M Jacoby H D Eckaus R S McFarland J Sarofim M Asadoorian M Babiker M'}, {'name': 'R G Prinn'}, {'name': 'Royal Society'}, {'name': 'S Paltsev'}, {'name': 'S Wu'}, {'name': 'United Nations'}, {'name': 'Webster M Paltsev S Parsons J Reilly J Jacoby H'}], [{'name': 'Blake, Donald R'}, {'name': 'Brune, William H'}, {'name': 'Crawford, James H'}, {'name': 'Fried, Alan'}, {'name': 'Kim, Sang-Woo'}, {'name': 'Oak, Yujin J'}, {'name': 'Park, Rokjin J'}, {'name': 'Schroeder, Jason R'}, {'name': 'Weinheimer, Andrew J'}, {'name': 'Wisthaler, Armin'}, {'name': 'Woo, Jung-Hun'}, {'name': 'Yeo, Huidong'}]]	['Global Health and Economic Impacts of Future Ozone Pollution', 'Evaluation of simulated O-3 production efficiency during the KORUS-AQ campaign: Implications for anthropogenic NOx emissions in Korea']	2.0	navigational	0.9465333235392286

astrophysical outflow has been proposed as a viable mechanism for the
acceleration of cosmic particles to ultra high energies. Here we present
simulation results that clearly demonstrate the viability of this mechanism for
the first time. We invoke the high frequency and high speed whistler mode for
the driving pulse. The plasma wakefield so induced validates precisely the
theoretical prediction. We show that under appropriate conditions, the plasma
wakefield maintains very high coherence and can sustain high-gradient
acceleration over a macroscopic distance. Invoking gamma ray burst (GRB) as the
source, we show that MPWA production of ultra high energy cosmic rays (UHECR)
beyond ZeV 10^21 eV is possible.Comment: 4 pages, 4 figure There are two very different interpretations of the prehistory of Island Southeast Asia (ISEA), with genetic evidence invoked in support of both. The “out-of-Taiwan” model proposes a major Late Holocene expansion of Neolithic Austronesian speakers from Taiwan. An alternative, proposing that Late Glacial/postglacial sea-level rises triggered largely autochthonous dispersals, accounts for some otherwise enigmatic genetic patterns, but fails to explain the Austronesian language dispersal. Combining mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA), Y-chromosome and genome-wide data, we performed the most comprehensive analysis of the region to date, obtaining highly consistent results across all three systems and allowing us to reconcile the models. We infer a primarily common ancestry for Taiwan/ISEA populations established before the Neolithic, but also detected clear signals of two minor Late Holocene migrations, probably representing Neolithic input from both Mainland Southeast Asia and South China, via Taiwan. This latter may therefore have mediated the Austronesian language dispersal, implying small-scale migration and language shift rather than large-scale expansion This study presents the perceived and projected image of Taiwan as a travel destination from perspectives from Mainland China. The perceived image of Taiwan was examined by interviewing 28 Mainland Chinese; the projected image of Taiwan was investigated by analyzing articles in China's most popular travel magazines. The different types of images of Taiwan among visitors, nonvisitors, and travel magazines were compared. The projected image changed notably after the opening of Taiwan's tourism to travelers from Mainland China. The results of this study could help destination marketing organizations to assess their marketing strategies for the Mainland Chinese travel market There has been a long-standing debate concerning the extent to which the spread of Neolithic ceramics and Malay-Polynesian languages in Island Southeast Asia (ISEA) were coupled to an agriculturally driven demic dispersal out of Taiwan 4000 years ago (4 ka). We previously addressed this question using founder analysis of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) control-region sequences to identify major lineage clusters most likely to have dispersed from Taiwan into ISEA, proposing that the dispersal had a relatively minor impact on the extant genetic structure of ISEA, and that the role of agriculture in the expansion of the Austronesian languages was therefore likely to have been correspondingly minor. Here we test these conclusions by sequencing whole mtDNAs from across Taiwan and ISEA, using their higher chronological precision to resolve the overall proportion that participated in the “out-of-Taiwan” mid-Holocene dispersal as opposed to earlier, postglacial expansions in the Early Holocene. We show that, in total, about 20 % of mtDNA lineages in the modern ISEA pool result from the “out-of-Taiwan” dispersal, with most of the remainder signifying earlier processes, mainly due to sea-level rises after the Last Glacial Maximum. Notably, we show that every one of these founder clusters previously entered Taiwan from China, 6–7 ka, where rice-farming originated, and remained distinct from the indigenous Taiwanese population until after the subsequent dispersal into ISEA Taiwan ; Economic development - Taiwan A Collaboration comprising Taiwan and mainland Chinese scientists has been
built up since 1996 to pursue a experimental program in neutrino and
astro-particle physics in Taiwan. A pilot experiment to be performed at the
Nuclear Power Station II in Taiwan is now under intense preparation. It will
make use of a 600 kg CsI(Tl) crystal calorimeter to study various neutrino
interactions. The feasibility of performing a long baseline reactor neutrino
experiment will also be investigated. The conceptual design and the physics to
be addressed by the pilot experiment are presented.Comment: 14 pages, 8 figures, 2 table On Feb. 5 2016 (UTC), an earthquake with moment magnitude 6.4 occurred in
southern Taiwan, known as the 2016 (Southern) Taiwan earthquake. In this study,
evidences of seismic earthquake precursors for this earthquake event are
investigated. Results show that ionospheric anomalies in Total Electric Content
(TEC) can be observed before the earthquake. These anomalies were obtained by
processing TEC data, where such TEC data are calculated from phase delays of
signals observed at densely arranged ground-based stations in Taiwan for Global
Navigation Satellite Systems. This shows that such anomalies were detected
within 1 hour before the event"	['563568', '8365355', '8364388', '8363882', '2493161', '968003', '52210799']	[[{'name': '/SLAC'}, {'name': '/Taiwan, Natl. Chiao Tung U. /Taiwan, Natl.

197f8426-db9c-4d75-a305-e82b20f9a30a	prevalencia	"Background: Data on spirometrically defined chronic airflow limitation (CAL) are scarce in developing countries.  Objective: To estimate the prevalence of spirometrically defined CAL in Kashmir, North India.  Methods: Using Burden of Obstructive Lung Disease survey methods, we administered questionnaires to randomly selected adults aged 40 years. Post-bronchodilator spirometry was performed to estimate the prevalence of CAL and its relation to potential risk factors.  Results: Of 1100 participants initially recruited, 953 (86.9%) responded and 757 completed acceptable spirometry and questionnaires. The prevalence of a forced expiratory volume in 1 s/forced vital capacity (FEV1/FVC) ratio less than the lower limit of normal was 17.3% (4.5) in males and 14.8% (2.1) in females. Risk factors for CAL included higher age, cooking with wood and lower educational status. The prevalence of current smoking was 61% in males and 22% in females; most smoked hookahs. CAL was found equally in non-smoking males and females, and was independently associated with the use of the hookah, family history of respiratory disease and poor education. A self-reported doctor's diagnosis of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease was reported in 8.4/1000 (0.9% of females and 0.8% of males).  Conclusion: Spirometrically confirmed CAL is highly prevalent in Indian Kashmir, and seems to be related to the high prevalence of smoking, predominantly in the form of hookah smoking OBJECTIVE: To compare the cost-effectiveness of malaria treatment based on presumptive diagnosis with that of malaria treatment based on rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs). METHODS: We calculated direct costs (based on experience from Ethiopia and southern Sudan) and effectiveness (in terms of reduced over-treatment) of a free, decentralised treatment programme using artesunate plus amodiaquine (AS + AQ) or artemether-lumefantrine (ART-LUM) in a Plasmodium falciparum epidemic. Our main cost-effectiveness measure was the incremental cost per false positive treatment averted by RDTs. RESULTS: As malaria prevalence increases, the difference in cost between presumptive and RDT-based treatment rises. The threshold prevalence above which the RDT-based strategy becomes more expensive is 21% in the AS + AQ scenario and 55% in the ART-LUM scenario, but these thresholds increase to 58 and 70%, respectively, if the financing body tolerates an incremental cost of 1 euro per false positive averted. However, even at a high (90%) prevalence of malaria consistent with an epidemic peak, an RDT-based strategy would only cost moderately more than the presumptive strategy: +29.9% in the AS + AQ scenario and +19.4% in the ART-LUM scenario. The treatment comparison is insensitive to the age and pregnancy distribution of febrile cases, but is strongly affected by variation in non-biomedical costs. If their unit price were halved, RDTs would be more cost-effective at a malaria prevalence up to 45% in case of AS + AQ treatment and at a prevalence up to 68% in case of ART-LUM treatment. CONCLUSION: In most epidemic prevalence scenarios, RDTs would considerably reduce over-treatment for only a moderate increase in costs over presumptive diagnosis. A substantial decrease in RDT unit price would greatly increase their cost-effectiveness, and should thus be advocated. A tolerated incremental cost of 1 euro is probably justified given overall public health and financial benefits. The RDTs should be considered for malaria epidemics if logistics and human resources allow Antecedentes: el envío de contenidos sexuales (p.ej., fotos y vídeos) entre adolescentes a través de Internet y el teléfono móvil, o sexting, está recibiendo atención social creciente. Los objetivos de este estudio fueron: 1) analizar la prevalencia y tendencias por sexo y por edad del sexting entre adolescentes; y 2) examinar el perfil de personalidad de los adolescentes que participan en sexting. Método: participaron 3.223 adolescentes españoles entre 12 y 17 años (49,9% mujeres; edad media = 14,06, DT = 1,37) que completaron de forma anónima y voluntaria autoinformes sobre sexting y sobre los cinco grandes factores de personalidad. Resultados: la prevalencia total del sexting fue del 13,5%. La prevalencia fue del 3,4% a los 12 años y ascendió al 36,1% a los 17, mostrando una tendencia lineal creciente y significativa. En general, no se encontraron diferencias entre varones y mujeres. El perfil de personalidad de quienes se implicaron en sexting se caracterizó por una mayor Extraversión y Neuroticismo y por menor Amabilidad y Responsabilidad. Conclusiones: más allá que adoptar una perspectiva basada en los peligros del sexting, se hace necesario un enfoque educativo que enfatice el uso responsable e informado de las tecnologías de la información y la comunicaciónBackground: Voluntarily sending sexual content (e.g., photos, videos) among adolescents via the Internet and mobile phones, a phenomenon called sexting, is receiving increasing social and research attention. The aims of this study were: 1) to analyze the prevalence and trends of sexting among adolescents by gender and age and 2) to examine the personality profile of adolescents that participated in sexting. Method: The sample consisted of 3,223 Spanish adolescents from 12 to 17 years of age (49.9% female; mean age = 14.06, SD = 1.37) who anonymously and voluntarily completed self-report questionnaires on sexting and the big five personality factors. Results: The overall prevalence of sexting was 13.5%. The prevalence was 3.4% at 12 years old and increased to 36.1% at 17 years of age, showing a growing and significant linear trend. Overall, no differences were found between males and females. The personality profile of those involved in sexting was characterized by higher Extraversion and Neuroticism and by lower scores in Conscientiousness and Agreeableness. Conclusions: Given its high prevalence, beyond adopting a perspective based on the dangers of sexting, an educational approach that emphasizes responsible and informed use of information and communication technologies is necessary.Fil: Gámez Guadix, Manuel.

Material y métodos: El estudio incluyó a 5 071 estudiantes a los que se realizó antropometría, se determinó colesterol total y se les solicitó información sociodemográfica. Los grupos de estudiantes se muestrearon al comienzo del año escolar a partir de 2001 y hasta 2005. Resultados: La ocurrencia de sobrepeso y obesidad fue de 21.3% y 8.3% respectivamente. No hubo diferencias entre las prevalencias anuales o quinquenal. Doce por ciento presentó hipercolesterolemia. Ser varón, urbano e hipercolesterolémico se vinculó significativamente con sobrepeso y obesidad (p < 0.001). Conclusiones: La prevalencia de sobrepeso y obesidad se ha mantenido, lo que difiere de lo informado a nivel internacional y el factor sociodemográfico que más se asoció a la obesidad, fue el de vivir en la ciudad y ser hombre Introducción. El suicidio es una de las principales causas de muerte a nivel mundial, y el comportamiento suicida suele ser un pródromo de suicidio posterior.
Objetivo. Llevar a cabo una revisión sistemática y un metanálisis de la prevalencia y la variabilidad en el comportamiento suicida en la población adulta general europea entre 2008 y 2017.
Método. Se identificaron estudios con datos originales sobre el comportamiento suicida publicados entre 2008 y 2017 en siete bases de datos electrónicas. Se calcularon las prevalencias puntuales, anuales y vida para varios tipos de comportamiento suicida (deseos de muerte; ideación suicida; planificación de suicidio; intento de suicidio). Las tasas de prevalencia agrupadas se calcularon utilizando un modelo de efectos aleatorios. También se realizaron análisis de subgrupos y una metarregresión multivariante. 
Resultados. Se identificaron 24 artículos que contenían datos originales, los cuales proporcionaron 97 tasas de prevalencia de comportamiento suicida. Para todas las conductas suicidas, las cifras de prevalencia agrupadas fueron: prevalencia puntual: 4,82% (2,84-6,80), prevalencia anual: 2,9% (1,49-4,32) y prevalencia vida: 5,55% (4,31-6,79). El análisis de subgrupos mostró que las cifras de prevalencia vida para deseos de muerte e ideación suicida fueron mayores en estudios con una población de menos de 3,702 habitantes y en países del este de Europa. Finalmente, la metarregresión multivariante mostró diferencias con respecto al tipo de prevalencia (puntual, anual o vida) y el tipo de comportamiento suicida, los límite de edad superior e inferior contemplados, el tamaño de la población, la calidad del estudio y el área de estudio.

skills and concentration.



But there is very little evidence supporting these conclusions. We conducted two studies (still unpublished) that found educators and parents believe chess has many

educational benefits. But children in our study who played chess did not show significant improvements in standardised test scores compared to children who didn’t play Although the game of chess has often featured in psychological research, we know very little
about people who play chess, especially about children who take up chess as a hobby. This
study presents the personality profiles as measured with the Big Five model (BFQ-C;
Barbaranelli et al., 2003) of 219 young children who play chess and 50 of their peers who do
not. Children who score higher on Intellect/openness and Energy/extraversion are more likely to play chess while children who score higher on Agreeableness are less likely to be attracted to chess. Boys with higher scores on Agreeableness are less likely to take up chess than boys with lower scores. Considering that girls score higher on Agreeableness, this factor may provide one of the possible reasons why more boys are interested in chess. Although none of the Big Five factors were associated with self-reported skill level, a sub-sample of 25 elite players had significantly higher scores on Intellect/openness than their weaker chess playing peers Eugene Nalimov has completed the computation of a set of endgame tables for 6-man chess, and independently, Marc Bourzutschky has completed tables for 3-3 chess and for 4-2 chess where Black is not just ‘KP’. The ICGA salutes both achievements and looks ahead This is a review of progress in the Chess Endgame field. It includes news of the promulgation of Endgame Tables, their use, non-use and potential runtime creation. It includes news of data-mining achievements related to 7-man chess and to the field of Chess Studies. It includes news of an algorithm to create Endgame Tables for variants of the normal game of chess Although it is widely acknowledged that chess is the best example of an intellectual activity
among games, evidence showing the association between any kind of intellectual ability and
chess skill has been remarkably sparse. One of the reasons is that most of the studies
investigated only one factor (e.g., intelligence), neglecting other factors relevant for the acquisition of chess skill (e.g., amount of practice, years of experience). The present study investigated the chess skill of 57 young chess players using measures of intelligence (WISC
III), practice, and experience. Although practice had the most influence on chess skill, intelligence explained some variance even after the inclusion of practice. When an elite subsample of 23 children was tested, it turned out that intelligence was not a significant factor
in chess skill, and that, if anything, it tended to correlate negatively with chess skill. This
unexpected result is explained by a negative correlation between intelligence and practice in the elite subsample. The study demonstrates the dangers of focusing on a single factor in complex
real-world situations where a number of closely interconnected factors operate The 'WCSC 2019' World Chess Software Championship was the ICGA's ninth experimental test of computer chess software in a neutral hardware environment. Held in Macau, this event was won by KOMODO with JONNY and CHIRON scarcely separable in second and third Some 50,000 Win Studies in Chess challenge White to find an effectively unique route to a win. Judging the impact of less than absolute uniqueness requires both technical analysis and artistic judgment. Here, for the first time, an algorithm is defined to help analyse uniqueness in endgame positions objectively. The key idea is to examine how critical certain positions are to White in achieving the win. The algorithm uses sub-n-man endgame tables

(EGTs) for both Chess and relevant, adjacent variants of Chess. It challenges authors of EGT generators to generalise them to create EGTs for these chess variants.

It has already proved efficient and effective in an implementation for Starchess, itself a variant of chess. The approach also addresses a number of similar questions arising in endgame theory, games and compositions The extent to which the acquisition of expertise in knowledge-rich domains, such as chess, can be influenced by general individual characteristics, such as intelligence, has remained unclear. Some previous studies with children have documented significant correlations between chess skill and performance on some psychometric tests, such as performance IQ (Frydman & Lynn, 1992). However, we found no evidence for a correlation between chess skill and visual memory ability in a group of adult chess players (n=36, age = 28.4). This finding, together with other data in the literature, suggests that there is surprisingly little evidence that chess skill and visuo-spatial ability are associated in adults.  Thus, visual memory ability, and perhaps visuo-spatial intelligence, may be relatively unimportant factors in the long-term acquisition of chess skill"	['23053347', '344862', '216434', '214802', '344875', '8257960', '268247', '344012']	[[{'name': 'Gardiner, Graeme'}, {'name': 'Ormsby, Gail'}, {'name': 'van der Laan, Luke'}], [{'name': 'Ablow'}, {'name': 'Austin'}, {'name': 'Avni'}, {'name': 'Barbaranelli'}, {'name': 'Bilalić'}, {'name': 'Charness'}, {'name': 'Costa'}, {'name': 'Costa'}, {'name': 'Fernand Gobet'}, {'name': 'Frydman'}, {'name': 'Gobet'}, {'name': 'Goodwin'}, {'name': 'Harris'}, {'name': 'Horgan'}, {'name': 'Howard'}, {'name': 'Joireman'}, {'name': 'Kelly'}, {'name': 'Marsh'}, {'name': 'Mazur'}, {'name': 'Mazur'}, {'name': 'Measelle'}, {'name': 'Merim Bilalić'}, {'name': 'Muris'}, {'name': 'Peter McLeod'}, {'name': 'Rubinstein'}, {'name': 'Shiner'}, {'name': 'Simon'}], [{'name': 'Haworth, Guy McCrossan'}], [{'name': 'Haworth, Guy McCrossan'}], [{'name': 'Aagaard'}, {'name': 'Ackerman'}, {'name': 'Binet'}, {'name': 'Campitelli'}, {'name': 'Charness'}, {'name': 'Charness'}, {'name': 'Chase'}, {'name': 'Chase'}, {'name': 'Cohen'}, {'name': 'Cranberg'}, {'name': 'de Groot'}, {'name': 'de Groot'}, {'name': 'Detterman'}, {'name': 'Detterman'}, {'name': 'Djakow'}, {'name': 'Doll'}, {'name': 'Ericsson'}, {'name': 'Ericsson'}, {'name': 'Ericsson'}, {'name': 'Ericsson'}, {'name': 'Fernand Gobet'}, {'name': 'Fine'}, {'name': 'Fox'}, {'name': 'Frydman'}, {'name': 'Gagné'}, {'name': 'Gobet'}, {'name': 'Gobet'}, {'name': 'Gobet'}, {'name': 'Gobet'}, {'name': 'Gobet'}, {'name': 'Gobet'}, {'name': 'Grabner'}, {'name': 'Gruber'}, {'name': 'Guilford'}, {'name': 'Holding'}, {'name': 'Holding'}, {'name': 'Horgan'}, {'name': 'Howard'}, {'name': 'Howard'}, {'name': 'Howard'}, {'name': 'Howard'}, {'name': 'Howe'}, {'name': 'Irwing'}, {'name': 'Kaufman'}, {'name': 'Merim Bilalić'}, {'name': 'Neisser'}, {'name': 'Newell'}, {'name': 'Opwis'}, {'name': 'Peter McLeod'}, {'name': 'Saariluoma'}, {'name': 'Sattler'}, {'name': 'Sattler'}, {'name': 'Schmidt'}, {'name': 'Schmidt'}, {'name': 'Shepard'}, {'name': 'Simon'}, {'name': 'Sternberg'}, {'name': 'Unterrainer'}, {'name': 'Vicente'}, {'name': 'Ward'}, {'name': 'Waters'}], [{'name': 'Haworth, Guy'}, {'name': 'Krabbenbos, Jan'}, {'name': 'van den Herik, Jaap'}], [{'name': 'Haworth, Guy'}, {'name': 'Rusz, Arpad'}], [{'name': 'Gobet, F'}, {'name': 'Leyden, G'}, {'name': 'Waters, A'}]]	['Most people think playing chess makes you ‘smarter’, but the evidence isn’t clear on that', 'Personality profiles of young chess players', '6-man chess solved', 'Chess endgame update', 'Does chess need intelligence? – A study with young chess players', 'WCSC 2019: the 9th World Chess Software Championship', 'Position criticality in chess endgames', 'Visuo-spatial abilities in chess players']	8.0	exploratory	0.5
37544b7b-7d77-4822-bab9-a2795180a2c5	sleep deprivation	"Brief periods of sleep loss have long-lasting consequences such as impaired memory consolidation. Structural changes in synaptic connectivity have been proposed as a substrate of memory storage. Here, we examine the impact of brief periods of sleep deprivation on dendritic structure. In mice, we find that five hours of sleep deprivation decreases dendritic spine numbers selectively in hippocampal area CA1 and increased activity of the filamentous actin severing protein cofilin. Recovery sleep normalizes these structural alterations. Suppression of cofilin function prevents spine loss, deficits in hippocampal synaptic plasticity, and impairments in long-term memory caused by sleep deprivation. The elevated cofilin activity is caused by cAMP-degrading phosphodiesterase-4A5 (PDE4A5), which hampers cAMP-PKA-LIMK signaling. Attenuating PDE4A5 function prevents changes in cAMP-PKA-LIMK-cofilin signaling and cognitive deficits associated with sleep deprivation. Our work demonstrates the necessity of an intact cAMP-PDE4-PKA-LIMK-cofilin activation-signaling pathway for sleep deprivation-induced memory disruption and reduction in hippocampal spine density Recent evidence suggests that nearly 25% of U.S. adults (47 million) suffer from some level of sleep deprivation. The impact of this sleep deprivation on the U.S. economy includes direct medical expenses related to sleep deprivation and related disorders, the cost of accidents, and the cost of reduced worker productivity. Sleep research has examined the effects of sleep deprivation on a number of performance measures, but the effects of sleep deprivation on decision-making under uncertainty are largely unknown. In this article, subjects perform a decision task (Grether, 1980) in both a well-rested and experimentally sleep-deprived state. The experimental task allows us to explore the extent to which subjects weight prior odds versus new evidence (i.e., information) when forming subjective (posterior) beliefs of a particular event. Wellrested subjects display a tendency to overweight the evidence in forming subjective posterior probability estimates, which is inconsistent with Bayes rule but possibly consistent with use of a ‘representativeness’ heuristic. In his original Bayes rule experiment, Grether (1980) also found that typical student-subjects overweighted the evidence relative to the prior odds in making posterior assessments. Ironically, behavior following sleep-deprivation is more consistent with the use of Bayes rule, because this treatment significantly reduces the (over)weight that subjects place on the new evidence. Because choice accuracy is not significantly affected by sleep deprivation, the significant difference in estimated decision-model parameters may indicate that the brain compensates under adversity in certain risky choice decision environments. Sleep deprivation increases rates of forgetting in episodic memory. Yet, whether an extended lack of sleep alters the qualitative nature of forgetting is unknown. We compared forgetting of episodic memories across intervals of overnight sleep, daytime wakefulness and overnight sleep deprivation. Item-level forgetting was amplified across daytime wakefulness and overnight sleep deprivation, as compared to sleep. Importantly, however, overnight sleep deprivation led to a further deficit in associative memory that was not observed after daytime wakefulness. These findings suggest that sleep deprivation induces fragmentation among item memories and their associations, altering the qualitative nature of episodic forgetting The body requires adequate sleep in order to maintain proper physiological health, psychological health, and cognitive function. In the healthcare field, sufficient sleep is imperative to ensure optimal patient care. Sleep deprivation can result in greater procedural errors, which places the clients at risk. Insufficient sleep negatively affects the nervous system, resulting in poor brain function. Because of the cognitive decline that is associated with sleep deprivation, academic performance is often decreased. In order to combat the phenomenon of sleep deprivation, positive lifestyle behaviors and sleep hygiene should be maintained. For students, academic and financial demands can contribute to physiological stress, which may cause impaired sleep quality. In particular, poor sleep quality, insomnia, and daytime sleepiness are reportedly prevalent in college students. Therefore, it is crucial that the effects of sleep deprivation in university students be further studied and interventions to alleviate the problem be explored.
Through a thorough review of the research literature and a proposal for further research, this thesis investigates the questions:   How will sleep deprivation affect college students, specifically their physiological health, psychological health, and cognitive function? How will ongoing sleep deprivation impact students\u27 academic performance through their four years at university"	['26052483', '2975447', '37098733', '79235764']	[[{'name': 'Abel, Ted'}, {'name': 'Aton, Sara J.'}, {'name': 'Baillie, George S.'}, {'name': 'Bruinenberg, Vibeke M.'}, {'name': 'Day, Jonathan P.'}, {'name': 'Ferri, Sarah L.'}, {'name': 'Hansen, Rolf T.'}, {'name': 'Havekes, Robbert'}, {'name': 'Houslay, Miles D.'}, {'name': 'Luczak, Vincent G.'}, {'name': 'Meerlo, Peter'}, {'name': 'Park, Alan J.'}, {'name': 'Poplawski, Shane G.'}, {'name': 'Radwanska, Kasia'}, {'name': 'Tudor, Jennifer C.'}], [{'name': 'David L.

A significant change is the emergence of artificial intelligence, which has become an integral part of the teaching and learning process. This article aims to explore the understanding of artificial intelligence and the risks associated with it in the context of education. The approach used is through a literature study by analyzing relevant scientific articles. The data collected is analyzed to discuss the impact of the dependent use of artificial intelligence in education. The results show several risks associated with the dependent use of artificial intelligence in education, including potential errors and inaccuracies in artificial intelligence systems, moral issues, and psychological impacts. The article also proposes some measures for using artificial intelligence to overcome these risks. This article aims to provide a better understanding of the use of artificial intelligence in education and offer guidance on how to deal with the risks that may arise Artificial Intelligence (AI) technologies have been researched in educational contexts for more than 30 years (Woolf 1988; Cumming and McDougall 2000; du Boulay 2016). More recently, commercial AI products have also entered the classroom. However, while many assume that Artificial Intelligence in Education (AIED) means students taught by robot teachers, the reality is more prosaic yet still has the potential to be transformative (Holmes et al. 2019). This chapter introduces AIED, an approach that has so far received little mainstream attention, both as a set of technologies and as a field of inquiry. It discusses AIED’s AI foundations, its use of models, its possible future, and the human context.

8abd8bf6-45b2-40e4-bfc2-d1f15513a9ce	neogene	"The Miocene-Pliocene Pannonian Lake formed in an extensional basin system behind the compressional arc of the

Carpathians. Its size and depth were comparable to those of the Caspian Sea. Subsidence began in Middle Miocene times,

forming deep, pelagic basins, separated by reef-bearing ridges. Clastic influx filled the marginal basins during Middle Miocene time. Prograding deltas dissected the lake and completed the infilling of the basin system by the end of the Pliocene. Basin plain, prodelta, delta front, delta plain, beach, fluviatile, and marsh environments can be recognized. Terminal Miocene uplift of the Carpathians isolated the Pannonian region from the rest of Paratethys. The subsequent decrease of salinity resulted in the evolution of an endemic, freshwater mollusc fauna. Rich nutrient influx from rivers supported high organic productivity (dinoflagellates, diatoms, nannoplankton, foraminifers, ostracods, etc.), yielding organic-rich

sediments. Preservation of organic matter was helped by a stratified water column and oxygen deficient bottom conditions. Deep burial, continuing subsidence, and high geothermal flux due to an extremely thin crust, led to the formation of commercially exploitable oil and gas accumulations. Shallow lacustrine zones of basin margins provided suitable environments for a rich Congeria-Melanopsis mollusc fauna. Wave action on beaches produced commercially exploitable pure quartz sand deposits. Taxodium and Alnus forests flourished around the lake producing enormous lignite deposits. Besides a rich land snail and mammal fauna, prehominids lived in the forests. There was a warm, temperate climate, with probably frostfree winters. Basaltic volcanoes overlooked the landscape, and maars hosted minor lakes with rich algal flora forming oil shale. The catchment area included most of the Carpathians and parts of the Alps and Dinarides. The positive water balance resulted in a supposed overflow in the southern margin, supplying exotic fauna to the South Carpathian and Dacian basins of the Eastern Paratethys. The Pannonian Lake was completely filled by the end of Pliocene. Recent lakes in the Carpathian Basin are not descendants of it The area of Alfambra (NE Spain) is very representative of the relief evolution of the Eastern Iberian ranges. It contains the main geomorphological elements that illustrate this evolutionary process. The geomorphological cartography includes the northern sector of the Alfambra-Teruel Neogene depression and its mountainous surroundings. The cartographic process started by using aerial photographs (1:30000 scale) and fieldwork. Later, the document was projected to the UTM Zone 30 system with ETRS_1989 Datum introduced to ArcGIS 10.1. The legend follows a chronological order. The structural reliefs, erosion surfaces, karst landforms, Quaternary pediments and terraces, and fluvial network are represented over a lithological background. The main cartography is complemented with two maps of lithological and geomorphological units. The obtained information enabled the main geological and geomorphological stages of the regional relief to be established.Fil: Sánchez Fabre, Miguel. Universidad de Zaragoza.

Centro Científico Tecnológico Conicet - Tucumán; Argentin Analysis of the stratigraphic architecture of the fills of Wanganui, King Country, and eastern Taranaki Basins reveals the occurrence of five 2nd order Late Paleocene and Neogene sequences of tectonic origin. The oldest is the late Eocene-Oligocene Te Kuiti Sequence, followed by the early-early Miocene (Otaian) Mahoenui Sequence, followed by the late-early Miocene (Altonian) Mokau Sequence, all three in King Country Basin. The fourth is the middle Miocene to early Pliocene Whangamomona Sequence, and the fifth is the middle Pliocene-Pleistocene Rangitikei Sequence, both represented in the three basins. Higher order sequences (4th, 5th, 6th) with a eustatic origin occur particularly within the Whangamomona and Rangitikei Sequences, particularly those of 6th order with 41 000 yr periodicity Shallow-water carbonate systems are reliable recorders of sea level fluctuations and changes in ambient seawater conditions. Drilling results from Ocean Drilling Program (ODP) Legs 133 and 166 indicate that the timing of late Neogene sedimentary breaks triggered by sea level lowerings is synchronous in the sedimentary successions of the Queensland Plateau and the Great Bahama Bank. This synchrony indicates that these sea level changes were eustatic in origin. The carbonate platforms were also affected by contemporary, paleoceanographically controlled fluctuations in carbonate production. Paleoceanographic changes are recorded at 10.7, 3.6, and 1.7–2.0 Ma. At the Queensland Plateau, sea surface temperature shifts are documented by shifts from tropical to temperate carbonates (10.7 Ma) and vice versa (3.6 Ma); the modern tropical platform was established at 2.0–1.8 Ma. At Great Bahama Bank, changes were registered in compositional variations of platform-derived sediment, such as major occurrence of peloids (3.6 Ma) and higher rates of neritic carbonate input (1.7 Ma). The synchroneity of these changes attests to the far-field effects of modifications in the oceanographic circulation on shallow-water, low-latitude carbonate production"	['5096802', '40984118', '15104734', '8984177']	[[{'name': 'Kázmér, Miklós'}], [{'name': 'Peña Monné, José Luis'}, {'name': 'Sampietro Vattuone, Maria Marta'}, {'name': 'Sánchez Fabre, Miguel'}], [{'name': 'Bland, Kyle J.'}, {'name': 'Cartwright, Stuart J.'}, {'name': 'Hansen, Rochelle J.'}, {'name': 'Hayton, Shaun'}, {'name': 'Hendy, Austin J.W.'}, {'name': 'Kamp, Peter J.J.'}, {'name': 'McIntyre, Avon P.'}, {'name': 'Nelson, Campbell S.'}, {'name': 'Ngatai, Melodie'}, {'name': 'Vonk, Adam J.'}], [{'name': 'Anselmetti'}, {'name': 'Beach'}, {'name': 'Berggren'}, {'name': 'Betzler'}, {'name': 'Betzler'}, {'name': 'Betzler'}, {'name': 'Betzler'}, {'name': 'Betzler'}, {'name': 'Bliefnick'}, {'name': 'Christian Betzler'}, {'name': 'Cotillon'}, {'name': 'Dick Kroon'}, {'name': 'Droxler'}, {'name': 'Droxler'}, {'name': 'Eberli'}, {'name': 'Eberli'}, {'name': 'Fulthorpe'}, {'name': 'Gartner'}, {'name': 'Gartner'}, {'name': 'Ginsburg'}, {'name': 'Haq'}, {'name': 'Hardenbol'}, {'name': 'Haug'}, {'name': 'Immenhauser'}, {'name': 'Isern'}, {'name': 'Isern'}, {'name': 'James'}, {'name': 'John J.

Here we use measurements of tropospheric ozone from the Tropospheric Emission Spectrometer satellite instrument, together with chemical transport and radiative transfer models, to produce a first estimate of the stratospherically adjusted annual radiative effect (RE) of tropospheric ozone. We show that differences between modeled and observed ozone concentrations have little impact on the RE, indicating that our present-day tropospheric ozone RE estimate of 1.17 ± 0.03 W m−2 is robust. The RE normalized by column ozone decreased between the preindustrial and the present-day. Using a simulation with historical biomass burning and no anthropogenic emissions, we calculate a radiative forcing of 0.32 W m−2 for tropospheric ozone, within the current best estimate range. We propose a radiative kernel approach as an efficient and accurate tool for calculating ozone REs in simulations with similar ozone abundances Radiative forcing due to changes in ozone is expected for the 21st century. An assessment on changes in the tropospheric oxidative state through a model intercomparison (""OxComp'') was conducted for the IPCC Third Assessment Report (IPCC-TAR). OxComp estimated tropospheric changes in ozone and other oxidants during the 21st century based on the ""SRES'' A2p emission scenario. In this study we analyze the results of 11 chemical transport models (CTMs) that participated in OxComp and use them as input for detailed radiative forcing calculations. We also address future ozone recovery in the lower stratosphere and its impact on radiative forcing by applying two models that calculate both tropospheric and stratospheric changes. The results of OxComp suggest an increase in global-mean tropospheric ozone between 11.4 and 20.5 DU for the 21st century, representing the model uncertainty range for the A2p scenario. As the A2p scenario constitutes the worst case proposed in IPCC-TAR we consider these results as an upper estimate. The radiative transfer model yields a positive radiative forcing ranging from 0.40 to 0.78 W m(-2) on a global and annual average. The lower stratosphere contributes an additional 7.5-9.3 DU to the calculated increase in the ozone column, increasing radiative forcing by 0.15-0.17 W m(-2). The modeled radiative forcing depends on the height distribution and geographical pattern of predicted ozone changes and shows a distinct seasonal variation. Despite the large variations between the 11 participating models, the calculated range for normalized radiative forcing is within 25%, indicating the ability to scale radiative forcing to global-mean ozone column change We examine the impact of assimilating ozone observations from the Tropospheric Emission Spectrometer (TES) on North American surface ozone abundances in the GEOS-Chem model in August 2006. The assimilation reduces the negative bias in the modeled free tropospheric ozone, which enhances the ozone flux into the boundary layer. Surface ozone abundances increased by as much as 9 ppb in western North America and by less than 2 ppb in the southeast, resulting in a total background source of ozone of 20-40 ppb. The enhanced ozone in the model reduced the model bias with respect to surface ozone observations in the western USA, but exacerbated it in the east. This increase in the bias in the boundary layer in the east, despite the agreement between the assimilation and ozonesonde measurements in the free troposphere, suggests errors in the ozone sources or sinks or in boundary layer mixing in the model. © 2009 A survey has been made of total and tropospheric ozone dynamics in the context of its impacts on climate, human health and ecosystems. Observation data on total ozone content (TOZ) in the atmosphere and relevant numerical modelling results have been discussed as well as similar information for tropospheric ozone, whose formation and changes are being determined by quite different causes. A

necessity has been emphasized to get more adequate global observational data on TOZ and tropospheric ozone (this is especially important in the latter case, because information on tropospheric ozone is far from being complete). Unsolved problems relevant to both total and tropospheric ozone have been briefly considered Global ozone analyses, based on assimilation of stratospheric profile and ozone column measurements, and NOy predictions from the Real-time Air Quality Modeling System (RAQMS) are used to estimate the ozone and NOy budget over the continental United States during the July-August 2004 Intercontinental Chemical Transport Experiment-North America (INTEX-A). Comparison with aircraft, satellite, surface, and ozonesonde measurements collected during INTEX-A show that RAQMS captures the main features of the global and continental U.S. distribution of tropospheric ozone, carbon monoxide, and NOy with reasonable fidelity. Assimilation of stratospheric profile and column ozone measurements is shown to have a positive impact on the RAQMS upper tropospheric/lower stratosphere ozone analyses, particularly during the period when SAGE III limb scattering measurements were available. Eulerian ozone and NOy budgets during INTEX-A show that the majority of the continental U.S. export occurs in the upper troposphere/lower stratosphere poleward of the tropopause break, a consequence of convergence of tropospheric and stratospheric air in this region. Continental U.S. photochemically produced ozone was found to be a minor component of the total ozone export, which was dominated by stratospheric ozone during INTEX-A. The unusually low photochemical ozone export is attributed to anomalously cold surface temperatures during the latter half of the INTEX-A mission, which resulted in net ozone loss during the first 2 weeks of August. Eulerian NOy budgets are shown to be very consistent with previously published estimates. The NOy export efficiency was estimated to be 24%, with NOx + PAN accounting for 54% of the total NOy export during INTEX-A.

ef25ebb9-761b-4e4b-b912-c7f998b71f2c	editorial	This paper reviews contributions to the journal Britannia over the last 50 years, and considers future directions. Papers are examined in relation to topic and the gender and professional associations of authors Therefore, in its variety, the contributions in this special issue share theorisations, auto-ethnographic reflections, and pedagogical experiments of decolonisation, politics of knowledge, and activism informed by Feminist, Gender, and Queer studies but also by non-Eurocentred epistemic geo-genealogies grounded in embodied experiences of racialisation, discrimination, and resistance in the academia. Inserting what are inevitably profoundly political contributions, which question the foundations and limitations of hegemonic knowledge creation, into the mould of an academic peer-reviewed special issue is a complex and, at times, seemingly impossible exercise. As the guest editors and editorial board negotiated the process of this issue’s production, we ourselves were challenged to engage with tensions around what constitutes a ‘proper’ scientific contribution, by which and whose standards. As a reader of this special issue, and perhaps a student, teacher, researcher, activist, or a combination thereof, it is likely that you also find yourself addressed and challenged by some of the critiques and proposals articulated in the articles and essays that follow Information about the publication, such as the Editorial Advisory Board and the Editorial Policy, and the Editor\u27s Preface for the issue This is my last editorial before I step down from the ALT-J editorial team. Rhona Sharpe and Frances Bell, will form the new ALT-J editorial team and I wish them the best of luck in developing the direction of ALT-J in the future. I would also like to thank the rest of outgoing editorial team, the ALT-J editorial board, the reviewers and authors that I have worked with over the last six issues of ALT-J, who each in their way has contributed to furthering our knowledge and understanding of the relationship between technology and learning This editorial sets the context for issue 36 of the NICEC journal which is focused on social justice and career guidance. The editorial explores the key themes of the issue highlighting the social justice tradition within the career guidance field and making the case for a strong focus on social justice. However the editorial also highlights the tensions that exist between career guidance’s orientation to the individual and understandings of social justice which are more socially orientated. The editorial concludes by arguing that if career guidance is to formulate a meaningful response to social injustice it needs to draw on diverse theoretical traditions and stimulate new forms of practice	['231198', '8257837', '8058329', '34095754', '217448', '8960965']	[[{'name': ''}, {'name': 'Abella'}, {'name': 'Arshid'}, {'name': 'Aufderheide'}, {'name': 'Chamberlain'}, {'name': 'Chan'}, {'name': 'Chen'}, {'name': 'Christenson'}, {'name': 'Devita'}, {'name': 'Edelson'}, {'name': 'Edelson'}, {'name': 'Eftestol'}, {'name': 'Hallstrom'}, {'name': 'Hernandez'}, {'name': 'Hillman'}, {'name': 'Hunt'}, {'name': 'Jacobs'}, {'name': 'Kaplan'}, {'name': 'Kouwenhoven'}, {'name': 'Kramer-Johansen'}, {'name': 'Larsen'}, {'name': 'Leary'}, {'name': 'Nichol'}, {'name': 'Nichol'}, {'name': 'Nichol'}, {'name': 'Niles'}, {'name': 'Nolan'}, {'name': 'Nolan'}, {'name': 'Nolan'}, {'name': 'Nolan'}, {'name': 'Perkins'}, {'name': 'Perkins'}, {'name': 'Perkins'}, {'name': 'Querellou'}, {'name': 'Rea'}, {'name': 'Sanna'}, {'name': 'Sunde'}, {'name': 'Wayne'}, {'name': 'Yeung'}, {'name': 'Zuercher'}], [{'name': 'Allen'}, {'name': 'Burnham'}, {'name': 'Frere'}, {'name': 'Gilchrist'}, {'name': 'Gosden'}, {'name': 'Hella Eckardt'}, {'name': 'Hingley'}, {'name': 'Holbrook'}, {'name': 'Millett'}, {'name': 'Smith'}, {'name': 'Smith'}, {'name': 'Swift'}, {'name': 'Sørensen'}, {'name': 'Taylor'}, {'name': 'Wilson'}], [{'name': 'de Jong, Sara'}, {'name': 'Icaza, Rosalba'}, {'name': 'Vázquez, Rolando'}, {'name': 'Withaeckx, Sophie'}], [{'name': 'Coward, Harold'}], [{'name': 'Seale, Jane'}], [{'name': 'Hooley, Tristram'}, {'name': 'Sultana, Ronald G.'}]]	['Celebrating 50 years of cardiopulmonary resuscitation', 'Britannia in numbers: 50 years of the journal of Romano-British and kindred studies', 'Editorial: Decolonising the University', 'Introductory Information and Editor\\u27s Preface', 'Editorial', 'Career guidance for social justice']	6.0	exploratory	0.5

80b7262b-9432-4770-b7c2-b270e3d08566	postural sway	"Background: The notion of limb dominance has been commonly used in the upper extremity, yet the two lower extremities are often treated as equal for clinical purposes. But both the lower limbs may not be perfectly symmetrical. There are conflicts of results with relation to leg dominancy, postural sway and foot pressure, which aided us to study the effect of lateralization on foot pressure and postural sway in middle age population.Methods: Thirty two normal subjects were recruited based on criteria, whose dominant lower limb was ascertained, Foot Pressure and postural sway was assessed by weighing scale and postural sway meter respectively.Results: Descriptive statistics and two way ANOVA were used as statistical analysis. Foot Pressure showed significant difference (P value <0.05) between dominant and non-dominant leg. On the other hand postural sway showed significant antero-lateral sway towards dominant side (P value <0.001).Conclusions: Lateralization of foot pressure is significant over dominant leg while postural sway is significant over anterolateral dominant side Postural instability assessment is an important tool in fall risk analysis and for timely intervention of falls to reduce or prevent fall injuries. Traditionally fall risk is measured though postural sway assessment and is collected through forceplates by mapping Center of Pressure (COP) excursions or using motion analysis camera system for marker sway trajectories. However, both of these systems are expensive and lack portability to their usage in clinical environments. In this study, we developed a novel wearable low-cost MEMS inertial sensor and validated its usage for human postural sway assessment in standing posture with eyes open/closed, vibration/no vibration, and proprioception /low proprioception conditions. The two objectives of this study were: 1) To develop and validate an Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) for sway analysis 2) To determine the feasibility of the system in detecting human postural imbalances such as reduced proprioception or presence of stochastic resonance induced through subthreshold vibrations on the feet. The novel IMU was tested for sway against infra-red marker on a specialized platform with 4-degrees of freedom. Many parameters of postural sway such as sway velocity, Root Mean Square (RMS), and sway path length could successfully detect subtle postural changes due to varying proprioceptive and sub-threshold vibration conditions. We found agreement in sway signal determinism from the two methods.   Clinical Relevance— This wearable sensor technology has potential to determine balance in reliable, easy and accurate way in clinical environments Background: Foam pads are increasingly used on force platforms during balance assessments in order to produce increased instability thereby permitting the measurement of enhanced posturographic parameters. A variety of foam pads providing different material properties have thus been used, although it is still unclear which characteristics produce the most effective and reliable tests. Furthermore, the effects of participant bodyweight on the performance of the foam pads and outcome of the test are unknown. This project investigated how different foam samples affected postural sway velocity in participants of different weights. Method: Four foam types were tested according to a modified American Society for Testing and Materials standard method for testing flexible cellular materials. Thirty-six healthy male factory workers divided into three groups according to body mass were tested three times for each of the 13 randomly-selected experimental situations for changes in postural sway velocity in this cross-over study. Descriptive and inferential statistics were used to compare the results and evaluate the difference in sway velocity between mass groups. Results: For the materials considered here, the modulus of elasticity of the foam pads when compressed by 25% of their original heights was inversely proportional to their density. The largest changes in postural sway velocity were measured when the pads of highest stiffness were used, with memory foam pads being the least likely to produce significant changes. Conclusions: The type of foam pads used in posturography is indeed important. Our study shows that the samples with a higher modulus of elasticity produced the largest change in postural sway velocity during quiet stance. The results suggest that foam pads used for static computerised posturography should 1) possess a higher modulus of elasticity and 2) show linear deformation properties matched to the participants’ weight Motor dysfunction is a consistently reported but understudied aspect of schizophrenia. Postural sway area was examined in individuals with schizophrenia under four conditions with different amounts of visual and proprioceptive feedback: eyes open or closed and feet together or shoulder width apart. The nonlinear complexity of postural sway was assessed by detrended fluctuation analysis (DFA). The schizophrenia group (n = 27) exhibited greater sway area compared to controls (n = 37). Participants with schizophrenia showed increased sway area following the removal of visual input, while this pattern was absent in controls. Examination of DFA revealed decreased complexity of postural sway and abnormal changes in complexity upon removal of visual input in individuals with schizophrenia. Additionally, less complex postural sway was associated with increased symptom severity in participants with schizophrenia. Given the critical involvement of the cerebellum and related circuits in postural stability and sensorimotor integration, these results are consistent with growing evidence of motor, cerebellar, and sensory integration dysfunction in the disorder, and with theoretical models that implicate cerebellar deficits and more general disconnection of function in schizophrenia Background

Increased postural sway is well documented in patients suffering from non-specific low back pain, whereby a linear relationship between higher pain intensities and increasing postural sway has been described. No investigation has been conducted to evaluate whether this relationship is maintained if pain levels change in adults with non-specific low back pain.



Methods

Thirty-eight patients with non-specific low back pain and a matching number of healthy controls were enrolled. Postural sway was measured by three identical static bipedal standing tasks of 90 sec duration with eyes closed in narrow stance on a firm surface. The perceived pain intensity was assessed by a numeric rating scale (NRS-11). The patients received three manual interventions (e.g. manipulation, mobilization or soft tissue techniques) at 3-4 day intervals, postural sway measures were obtained at each occasion.



Results

A clinically relevant decrease of four NRS scores in associated with manual interventions correlated with a significant decrease in postural sway. In contrast, if no clinically relevant change in intensity occurred ([less than or equal to]1 level), postural sway remained similar compared to baseline. The postural sway measures obtained at follow-up sessions 2 and 3 associated with specific NRS level showed no significant differences compared to reference values for the same pain score.



Conclusions

Alterations in self-reported pain intensities are closely related to changes in postural sway. The previously reported linear relationship between the two variables is maintained as pain levels change. Pain interference appears responsible for the altered sway in pain sufferers. This underlines the clinical use of sway measures as an objective monitoring tool during treatment or rehabilitation Here we explain the neural and mechanical mechanisms responsible for synchronizing sway and improving postural control during physical contact with another standing person. Postural control processes were modelled using an inverted pendulum under continuous feedback control. Interpersonal interactions were simulated either by coupling the sensory feedback loops or by physically coupling the pendulums with a damped spring. These simulations precisely recreated the timing and magnitude of sway interactions observed empirically. Effects of firmly grasping another person's shoulder were explained entirely by the mechanical linkage. This contrasted with light touch and/or visual contact, which were explained by a sensory weighting phenomenon; each person's estimate of upright was based on a weighted combination of veridical sensory feedback combined with a small contribution from their partner. Under these circumstances, the model predicted reductions in sway even without the need to distinguish between self and partner motion. Our findings explain the seemingly paradoxical observation that touching a swaying person can improve postural control.This work was supported by two BBSRC grants (BB/100579X/1 and an Industry Interchange Award) Orthotic devices have been shown to successfully modify selected aspects of lower extremity mechanics and enhance foot stability during the support phase of running. It was hypothesized that orthotic intervention would relieve excessive strain on the ankle ligaments and reduce postural sway, especially in subjects with acute ankle sprains. The primary purpose of this study was to determine if orthotics would reduce postural sway in injured and uninjured subjects. Thirteen subjects with acute inversion ankle sprains and 12 uninjured subjects were assessed for postural sway on the Balance System under two treatment conditions (orthotic and nonorthotic) and four platform movements. A three-factor repeated measures analysis of variance revealed a significant group x treatment interaction, suggesting that postural sway with orthotic intervention improved significantly more in injured subjects than in uninjured subjects. A significant platform movement x treatment interaction, furthermore, revealed that postural sway for the four movement conditions was dependent upon treatment (orthotic vs. no orthotic). Tukey post hoc analysis revealed that orthotic intervention significantly reduced postural sway when the platform moved in the medial/lateral plane and inversion/eversion plane. This research suggests that custom-fit orthotics may restrict undesirable motion at the foot and ankle and enhance joint mechanoreceptors to detect perturbations and provide structural support for detecting and controlling postural sway in ankle-injured subjects"	['133369152', '96049378', '17703645', '5234724', '4051960', '8954110', '77251387']	"[[{'name': 'Kumar, Senthil'}, {'name': 'Maredia, Sulofana Iqbal'}, {'name': 'Sawant, Shraddha'}], [{'name': 'Pollind, Michael'}, {'name': 'Soangra, Rahul'}], [{'name': 'Fagan, Michael'}, {'name': 'Gosselin, Guy'}], [{'name': 'Bolbecker, Amanda R.'}, {'name': 'Forsyth, Jennifer K.'}, {'name': 'Hetrick, William P.'}, {'name': 'Hong, S.

MM cells depend on a multitude of cells within the bone marrow microenvironment to flourish and resist treatment-induced cell death. Bone marrow adipocytes (BMAd), which increase in number with aging and obesity, have been shown to support myeloma cells by inducing proliferation, migration, and drug resistance, and ultimately contributing to myeloma patient relapse from remission. Herein we confirm the pro-myeloma effects of BMAd conditioned media (CM) and investigate the effects of the family of proteins termed the fatty acid binding proteins (FABPs), which are expressed both by adipocytes and tumor cells themselves. We found that high levels of FABP5 in patient myeloma cells corresponds to poor overall and relapse free survival for MM patients. Moreover, we found that pharmacologically inhibiting fatty acid binding proteins negatively impact tumor burden in vitro and in vivo,ultimately leading to increased survival of tumor-bearing mice. In addition, when combined with FABP inhibitors, dexamethasone, a common anti-myeloma treatment, has increased efficacy in vitro. Overall, these data suggest that FABPs are a novel target in myeloma and that this is a potential new cancer therapeutic target should be developed fuither Long-term manned space exploration to the moon, Mars, and other areas beyond Earth\u27s protective magnetic field poses possible acute and late central nervous systems (CNS) risks. Of particular concern for astronauts is exposure to high atomic number, high energy particles known as HZE particles, a component of galactic cosmic radiation (GCR). Although NASA has radiation safety requirements, the possible effects of GCR and HZE particles on the central nervous systems of astronauts remains unknown. Understanding the risks and effects of galactic cosmic radiation and HZE particles on the central nervous system will allow for safer space exploration.
Additionally, and perhaps more relevant, are the effects on the CNS of patients undergoing radiation therapy for cancer treatment or for medical procedures like CT scans. Radiation (using x-rays, gamma rays, and charged particles), along with chemotherapy, is widely used to treat primary and metastatic brain tumors. Despite advances in radiation therapy, significant negative impacts on the CNS still remain.
In this study, our aim was to understand the effects of x-ray radiation on neurite morphology and cytoskeleton structure using human SH-SYSY cells, a neuroblastoma cell line commonly used for neurite outgrowth studies. In addition, we monitored cytotoxicity via a metabolic proliferation assay in neuronal cells lines, as well as a primary glial cell line and glial cell line derived from a glioma. Immunocytochemistry results suggests that neurite length of differentiated SHSYSY cells decreases with increases in radiation dose and exposure time. Phase contrast microscopy results are contradictory; suggesting no significant differences between treated and control groups with regards to dose and time. Phase contrast microscopy does reveal neurite complexity decreases in differentiated SH-SYSY cells with select dosages and times of exposure.
Cytotoxicity results are wildly disparate between cells lines. Data indicate radiation dose and time post-treatment affect metabolic activity. However, metabolic activity between cell lines and within a cell line can either increase or decrease in response to dose and time This article was originally published in The Prophet -- a journal created by and for the students at the Boston University School of Theology (BUSTH) to amplify the voices of STH students by promoting and sharing a range of perspectives on matters of concern including, but not limited to, spiritual practices, faith communities and society, the nature of theology, and current affairs.

b44d33d1-88d6-47ec-ae67-256c0b37944c	report	"Spinning small silicate grains were recently invoked to account for the
Galactic foreground anomalous microwave emission. These grains, if present,
will absorb starlight in the far ultraviolet (UV). There is also renewed
interest in attributing the enigmatic 2175 Angstrom interstellar extinction
bump to small silicates. To probe the role of silicon in the UV extinction, we
explore the relations between the amount of silicon required to be locked up in
silicates [Si/H]_{dust} and the 2175 Angstrom bump or the far-UV extinction
rise, based on an analysis of the extinction curves along 46 Galactic
sightlines for which the gas-phase silicon abundance [Si/H]_{gas} is known. We
derive [Si/H]_{dust} either from {[Si/H]_{ISM} - [Si/H]_{gas}} or from the
Kramers-Kronig relation which relates the wavelength-integrated extinction to
the total dust volume, where [Si/H]_{ISM} is the interstellar silicon reference
abundance and taken to be that of proto-Sun or B stars. We also derive
[Si/H]_{dust} from fitting the observed extinction curves with a mixture of
amorphous silicates and graphitic grains. We find that in all three cases
[Si/H]_{dust} shows no correlation with the 2175 Angstrom bump, while the
carbon depletion [C/H]_{dust} tends to correlate with the 2175 Angstrom bump.
This supports carbon grains instead of silicates as the possible carrier of the
2175 Angstrom bump. We also find that neither [Si/H]_{dust} nor [C/H]_{dust}
alone correlates with the far-UV extinction, suggesting that the far-UV
extinction is a combined effect of small carbon grains and silicates.Comment: 38 pages, 15 figures, 2 tables; accepted for publication in The

  arXiv:1507.0659 The 10-year drug strategy for England and Wales was published in February 2008. It dropped drugs-related deaths (DRDs) as a key performance indicator. Scotland retained a necessary strong focus on DRDs. Scotland's DRDs numbered 1006 in 2000–02 and 1009 in 2003–05. The previous Scottish administration's claim that its number of current injectors had decreased substantially between 2000 and 2003 implied, paradoxically, that their DRD rate would have to have increased. Worse was to come: Scotland's DRDs had increased to 876 in 2006 + 2007. We analyse UK's DRDs by sex and age-group to reveal temporal trends (2000–02 versus 2003–05 versus 2006 + 2007) with different public health and epidemiological implications. We also address the above Scottish paradox and assess, by age-group, how consistent Scotland's 876 DRDs in 2006 + 2007 are with Scottish injectors’ DRD rate in 2003–05 of around 1 per 100 injector-years. Public health success in the UK in reducing DRDs at younger ages should not be overshadowed by the late consequence in terms of older-age DRDs of UK's injector epidemics; in the early 1980s in Scotland, and late 1980s in England and Wales. Targets for reducing DRDs should pay heed to UK's injector epidemics Contents in this issue:   The 1979 Montana Legislature - Robert E. Eagle

Various studies have proven that reading circles have a positive impact on students’ reading comprehension skills (Altınkaya, 2019; Avcı &amp; Yüksel, 2011; Balantekin, 2016; Brown, 2002; Kaya-Tosun, 2018; Sarı, Kurtuluş, &amp; Yücel-Toy, 2017). This study aims to improve students’ reading comprehension strategies and help them develop a positive attitude toward reading as well as contribute to their reading habits using the reading circle technique. The researcher and a Turkish teacher cooperated within the scope of this study, which was designed as action research, and they used the reading circle technique to improve students’ reading comprehension strategies as well as their reading attitudes and habits. This study was conducted with 28 students, and the students were divided into four groups with seven members to form small discussion groups. Reading circle sessions were held on Zoom for 10 weeks, with each session lasting 30 minutes for each group. In the present study, the “Book Metaphor Form” was developed by Gül (2019), and students’ progress was monitored by administering pre-test and post-test with the “Reading Habits and Attitudes Scale” as well as the “Reading Comprehension Strategies Scale” developed by Susar-Kırmızı (2006). The process was monitored through “Task Cards,” “Reading Circle Control List,” “Researcher Observation Form” and “Reading Circle Evaluation Form.” Results of the quantitative analyses showed that reading circles did not affect students’ reading comprehension strategies as well as their reading attitudes and habits. Results of the qualitative analyses indicated that reading circles had an increasing effect on students’ motivation to read a book, their positive attitudes toward books/reading, such as using the library and exchanging books, and their use of strategies to learn a new word. On the other hand, students were observed to be able to associate what they read with real life and improve their skills to make a summary and work in groups. At the end of the process, students’ metaphoric perceptions of books changed, and those who perceived books as a tool of amusement decreased while the number of students who regarded books as a source of information increased. In brief, the qualitative analyses conducted within the scope of this study suggested that students’ use of reading comprehension strategies as well as their attitudes and habits about reading improved, whereas this was not reflected in the quantitative data of this study. The current study results support the idea of using reading circles with secondary school students and point out because it is necessary to investigate the effect of reading circles with studies to be conducted with different groups for longer periods.Okuma çemberi; aynı hikâyeyi, şiiri, makaleyi veya kitabı okumayı seçen akranlar tarafından yönetilen küçük tartışma gruplarıdır (Daniels, 2002, s. 2). Bu araştırmada okuma çemberi tekniğinin kullanılmasıyla öğrencilerin okuduğunu anlama stratejilerini geliştirmek, okumaya karşı olumlu tutum geliştirmelerine ve okuma alışkanlıklarına katkı sağlamak amaçlanmıştır. Bu amaç doğrultusunda eylem araştırması olarak tasarlanan araştırmada, araştırmacı ve bir Türkçe öğretmeninin iş birliğinde okuma çemberi tekniği kullanılarak öğrencilerin okuduğunu anlama stratejileri, okuma tutum ve alışkanlıkları iyileştirilmeye çalışılmıştır. 28 öğrencinin katılımıyla gerçekleştirilen araştırmada öğrenciler yedişerli dört farklı gruba ayrılarak küçük tartışma grupları oluşturulmuştur. Okuma çemberi oturumları 10 hafta boyunca Zoom programı kullanılarak her grup için 30 dakika olacak şekilde çevrimiçi gerçekleştirilmiştir. Araştırma sürecinde “Kitap Metafor Formu”, Gül (2019) tarafından geliştirilmiş “Okuma Alışkanlığı ve Tutum Ölçeği”, Susar-Kırmızı’nın (2006) hazırladığı “Okuduğunu Anlama Stratejileri Ölçeği” ön ve son test olarak uygulanarak öğrencilerin gelişimleri izlenmiştir. Uygulama süreci, “Görev Kartları”, “Okuma Çemberi Kontrol Listesi” ve “Araştırmacı Gözlem Formu” ve “Okuma Çemberi Değerlendirme Formu” ile takip edilmiştir. Nicel analizlerden elde edilen verilere göre okuma çemberi uygulamaları, öğrencilerin okuduğunu anlama stratejileri ile okuma tutum ve alışkanlıklarının geliştirilmesine etki etmemektedir. Nitel analizlerden elde edilen verilere göre ise okuma çemberinin uygulanmasıyla öğrencilerin kitap okumaya yönelik motivasyonlarında, kütüphaneyi kullanma ve kitap değiş-tokuşu yapma gibi kitaba/okumaya yönelik olumlu tutumlarında ve sözcük öğrenme stratejilerini kullanmalarında iyileşme görülmüştür. Diğer yandan, öğrencilerin okunanları gerçek hayatla daha çok ilişkilendirilebildikleri ve özetleme becerileri ile grupla çalışma becerilerinin geliştiği gözlenmiştir. Uygulamalar sonucunda öğrencilerin kitaba ilişkin metaforik algıları değişmiş, kitabı eğlence aracı olarak görenler azalırken kitabı bilgi kaynağı olarak görenlerin arttığı görülmüştür. Kısacası, bu araştırmada nitel analizlerden elde edilen verilere göre öğrencilerin okuma stratejileri kullanımları ile okumaya yönelik tutum ve alışkanlıklarının olumlu yönde geliştiği gözlenmişken bu durum nicel analizlerden elde edilen verilere yansımamıştır. Araştırmanın sonuçları okuma çemberlerinin ortaokul düzeyindeki öğrencilere uygulanmasını desteklemekte ve farklı gruplarla daha uzun süre yürütülecek çalışmalarda okuma çemberlerinin etkisinin incelenmesinin gerekli olduğuna işaret etmektedir Bu makalede, Türk elektronik sanayiinde yapılan TÜSİAD/TESİD ve TTGV/TESİD

tarafından desteklenen iki ayrı saha çalısmasından elde edilen verilerden hareketle bu sektördeki rekabet ve teknoloji stratejileri ve yeni ürün gelistirme (YÜG) süreçleri değerlendirilmektedir. Birbirinden bağımsız olarak gerçeklestirilen TÜSİAD/TESİD ve TTGV/TESİD çalısmalarında sırası ile 27 ve 28 firma yer almıstır. Türk elektronik sanayiinde rekabet stratejisi, rekabetçi öncelikler, imalatta performans hedefleri ve aksiyon planlarının bir bütünü olarak irdelenmistir. Sektörün rekabet stratejisini ağırlıklı olarak kalite üzerine kurduğu saptanmıstır. Ancak, YÜG ve ürüne yönelik olarak gözlenen

yaklasımlar sektörün bu alanlara da öncelik verdiğine isaret etmektedir. Ar-Ge yoğunluğu KOBİ’ler için %3,6, büyük firmalar için %4,0 olarak belirlenmistir. Buna karsın, KOBİ’lerin ve büyük firmaların yeni teknoloji gelistirme yüzdesi oldukça düsük bulunmustur. Bu sonuç, Ar-Ge faaliyetlerinin büyük ölçüde YÜG faaliyetleri olarak gerçeklestirildiğini göstermektedir. Teknoloji stratejisinin olusturulmasında ve teknoloji stratejisinin is stratejisi ile bütünlüğünün sağlanmasında firmaların eksikleri olduğu görülmektedir. YÜG çabası içinde olan firmalarda ise, YÜG'e dayalı strateji eksikliği olduğu

anlasılmaktadır. Gerek teknoloji edinmede gerekse teknoloji aktarımında firmaların genelde oldukça kısıtlı kaldığı anlasılmaktadır. Teknoloji, Ar-Ge, YÜG alanlarında etkilesim arayüzlerinin artırılması gerekmektedir. Özellikle; arastırma kurumları ve üniversiteler ile daha yoğun iliskilere gereksinim vardır. Üniversiteler ile iliskiler, bu kurumların sanayiin en çok ihtiyacını çektiği yetismis insangücünün kaynağı olması nedeni ile ayrı bir önem kazanmaktadır. Nitekim gerek KOBİ'ler gerekse büyük firmalar nitelikli eleman bulmanın ve ise almanın güçlüğünü basarının önündeki en önemli ilk bes dıs engel içinde göstermislerdir. KOBİ'ler için, firmada nitelikli eleman eksikliği basarının önündeki engeller arasında en önemli iç faktör olarak gösterilmistir. Makalede, YÜG sürecinin asamaları, firmaların pazara giris ve pazarlama stratejileri ve YÜG projelerinin yönetimi konuları da ayrıntılı olarak incelenmistir Bu çalışmanın amacı, öğretmen adaylarında öğrenme stratejileri ve bireysel özelliklerin

were 265 studentsstudying in different major fields at the Faculty of Education in Pamukkale
University. Learning Strategies Inventory and Personal Information Sheet were used to gather
data. Results showed that academic achievement was predicted by deep learning strategies,
grade, gender and age. It was also seen that prospective teachers used deep learning strategies
more than surface learning strategies, deep learning strategies were positively correlated with
academic achievement, surface learning strategies did significiantly differ as to gender, while
metacognitive learning strategies did significiantly differ as to major field. Implications of the
findings were discussed and suggestions were given for the educators The aim of this study is to examine the correlation between the frequency of using metacognitive reading strategy use and non-routine problem-solving achievements in fifth grade students. The study was conducted by using the correlational survey model, one of quantitative research methods. The participants of the study consisted of 308 fifth grade students who were studying in public schools in Istanbul and Ankara in 2017-2018 school year and were selected with convenient sampling method. The data of the study were gathered using the form for the frequency of using metacognitive reading strategy by the students and the non-routine problem solving achievement Test. In the study, the form for the frequency of using metacognitive reading strategy was applied in order to determine metacognitive reading strategies of the studies and on the following day, the achievement test including non-routine problems was then applied to the students. Simple Linear Regression Analysis and Pearson Product-Moments Correlation Analysis were used in the analysis of the data obtained in the study. According to the results of the study, there was a positive correlation between the frequency of using metacognitive reading strategy and non-routine problem-solving achievements in fifth grade students and metacognitive reading strategies were a predictor of non-routine problem-solving achievement. © 2018 by authors.

The first section of the chapter is focused on the two main macro-economic policies namely inward-oriented development strategy prior to the year of 1980 and the outward-oriented development strategy after 1980. In the second section of the article regional disparities and the regional development policies in Turkey are briefly discussed. In the next section spatial effects of the outward oriented policies are analysed focusing on the spatial distribution of industry. Industrial shifts indicate that there are mainly four spatial development tendencies in Turkey namely, the rise of metropolitan cities as service centres, the industrial growth of hinterland provinces that are neighbouring cities around metropolitan cities on the basis of decentralising industry, the decline of economic activities in the provinces in which state economic enterprises are common, and the emergence of the new industrial districts/ cities on the basis of SMEs’ networks and sectoral specialisation. The last section of the paper analyses the emergence of new industrial districts in Turkey focusing on the main features of five territorial cities namely Denizli, Gaziantep, Ã‡orum, Kayseri and KahramanmaraÃ¾. It is concluded that the new industrial districts developed on the basis of SME clusters have crushed the spatial development trends in Turkey based on metropolitan cities and they have conveyed the development dynamics to small and medium sized Anatolian cities. The districts that have followed a development path within the framework of their own endogenous potentials have succeeded in becoming a centre of attraction and have started to serve a significant function in the transfer of development to the less developed Anatolia. By disrupting the unbalanced development tendencies on the national level, emerging around a few growth poles, they have yielded an alternative development tendency against the polarised development tendencies. Küreselleşme süreci ile birlikte artan rekabet, işletmeleri inovasyon yapmaya zorunlu kılmaktadır. KOBİ’ler değişken müşteri gereksinimlerine hızlı cevap verebilecek esnek bir yapıya sahip olmaları nedeniyle büyük işletmelere göre inovasyon konusunda daha avantajlı görülmektedir. Bu çalışma KOBİ’lerin inovasyon stratejilerinden hangilerini tercih ettiklerini ve inovasyon çeşitlerinden hangilerini uyguladıklarını tespit etmek amacıyla gerçek-leştirilmiştir. Çalışma ayrıca KOBİ’lerin çalışan sayıları ve yasal yapılarındaki farklılıkların inovasyon yapmayı ne derecede etkilediğini ve Ar-Ge’ye ayırdıkları pay ile inovasyon stratejileri arasındaki ilişkiyi incelemiştir. Elde edilen sonuçlar, çalışan sayısı arttıkça işletmelerin inovasyon yapma başarısının arttığını, inovasyon yapmanın KOBİ’lerin yasal yapısına göre farklılık göstermediğini ve Ar-Ge’ye ayrılan payın inovasyon stratejilerinin belirlenmesinde önemli rol oynadığını ortaya koymuştur.Increasing competitiveness through globalization process, has been forcing enterprises to innovate more than ever before. SMEs are considered to be more advantageous than large enterprises as they have a more flexible structure so as to meet costumers’ varying needs in an immediate manner. This study has been conducted to find out which innovation strategies enterprises prefer and which innovations they are using. Moreover, the study has examined to what extent the number of their employees and the variety in their legal structures influence their innovation activities and investigated the relation between their R&D allocations and innovation strategies. The findings have revealed that innovation success of enterprises improves along with the increase in the number of employees; involvement in innovation activities is unresponsive to type of legal structure of SMEs; and the size of R&D allocations plays a significant role in determining their innovation strategies Bu çalışmanın amacı, Türkiye’deki amatör ile profesyonel müzisyenlerin enstrümanlarındaki

önerisi getirilmişti This study aimed to determine the strategies used by Turkish language teachers within the scope of vocabulary development activities within the framework of mother tongue education and to reveal whether the level of use of vocabulary teaching strategies by Turkish language teachers is affected by the factors of length of professional experience and gender. In line with the objectives of the research, the data of the study, which was conducted in the survey model, one of the quantitative research methods, were obtained online through Vocabulary Teaching Strategies Scale (VTSS) in 2022-2023 school year. The sample of the research includes 401 teachers who work as Turkish teachers in middle schools affiliated to the Ministry of National Education. As a result of the statistical analysis of the data obtained within the scope of the research, it was found that Turkish teachers used vocabulary teaching strategies at a moderate level; the length of professional experience affected the frequency of using vocabulary teaching strategies; and gender had no effect on teachers' use of vocabulary teaching strategies. The study also found that teachers used control strategies the most and guidance strategies the least, and that the frequency of using vocabulary teaching strategies was in the order of control &gt; reinforcement &gt; explanation &gt; skill acquisition &gt; teaching &gt; guidance strategies. Based on these results, which were interpreted in the light of the literature, various suggestions were made for teachers and mother language education planners.Bu araştırmada, ana dili eğitimi çerçevesinde Türkçe öğretmeni olarak görev yapan öğreticilerin ana dili eğitimi derslerinde kelime hazinesini geliştirme etkinlikleri kapsamında başvurdukları stratejileri belirlemek ve öğreticilerin kelime öğretim stratejilerini kullanım düzeylerinin mesleki deneyim süresi ile cinsiyet faktörlerinden etkilenip etkilenmediğini ortaya çıkarmak amaçlanmıştır. Araştırmanın hedefleri doğrultusunda nicel araştırma yöntemlerinden tarama modelinde yürütülen çalışmanın verileri, çevrimiçi olarak Kelime Öğretim Stratejileri Ölçeği (KÖSÖ) vasıtasıyla 2022-2023 eğitim-öğretim yılı içerisinde elde edilmiştir. Araştırmanın örnekleminde Millî Eğitim Bakanlığına bağlı ortaokullarda Türkçe öğretmeni olarak görev yapan 401 öğretici yer almaktadır.

Smart technologies create new opportunities for a range of smart city development and regeneration programmes designed to address the environmental, economic and social challenges concentrated in cities. Whilst smart city programmes have received much publicity, there has been much less discussion about evaluation of smart city programmes and the measurement of their outcomes for cities. Existing evaluation approaches have been criticised as non-standard and inadequate, focusing more on implementation processes and investment metrics than on the impacts of smart city programmes on strategic city outcomes and progress.  To examine this, the SmartDframe project conducted research on city approaches to the evaluation of smart city projects and programmes, and reporting of impacts on city outcomes. This included the ‘smarter’ UK cities of Birmingham, Bristol, Manchester, Milton Keynes and Peterborough. City reports and interviews with representative local government authorities informed the case study analysis. The report provides a series of smart city case studies that exemplify contemporary city practices, offering a timely, insightful contribution to city discourse about best practice approaches to evaluation and reporting of complex smart city projects and programmes Modern cities are embracing cutting-edge technologies to improve the services they offer to the citizens from traffic control to the reduction of greenhouse gases and energy provisioning. In this chapter, we look at the energy sector advocating how Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) and signal processing techniques can be integrated into next generation power grids for an increased effectiveness in terms of: electrical stability, distribution, improved communication security, energy production, and utilization. In particular, we deliberate about the use of these techniques within new demand response paradigms, where communities of prosumers (e.g., households, generating part of their electricity consumption) contribute to the satisfaction of the energy demand through load balancing and peak shaving. Our discussion also covers the use of big data analytics for demand response and serious games as a tool to promote energy-efficient behaviors from end users The smart and resilient city evolves by slow procedures of mutation without radical changes, increasing the livability of its territory. The value of the city center in a Smart City can increase through urban lighting systems: its elements on the territory can collect and convey data to increase services to city users; the electrical system becomes the so-called Smart Grid. This paper presents a study of smart lighting for a small town, a touristic location inside a nature reserve on the Italian coast. Three different approaches have been proposed, from minimal to more invasive interventions, and their effect on the territory has been investigated. Based on street typology and its surroundings, the work analyzes the opportunity to introduce smart and useful services for the citizens starting from a retrofitting intervention. Smart city capabilities are examined, showing how it is possible to provide new services to the cities through ICT (Information and Communication Technology) without deep changes and simplifying the control of basic city functions. The results evidence an important impact on annual energy costs, suggesting smart grid planning not only for metropolis applications, but also in smaller towns, such as the examined one Notions of the Smart City are pervasive in urban development discourses. Various frameworks for the development of smart cities, often conceptualized as roadmaps, make a number of implicit claims about how smart city projects proceed but the legitimacy of those claims is unclear. This paper begins to address this gap in knowledge. We explore the development of a smart transport application, MotionMap, in the context of a £16M smart city programme taking place in Milton Keynes, UK. We examine how the idealized smart city narrative was locally inflected, and discuss the differences between the narrative and the processes and outcomes observed in Milton Keynes. The research shows that the vision of data-driven efficiency outlined in the roadmaps is not universally compelling, and that different approaches to the sensing and optimization of urban flows have potential for empowering or disempowering different actors. Roadmaps tend to emphasize the importance of delivering quick practical results. However, the benefits observed in Milton Keynes did not come from quick technical fixes but from a smart city narrative that reinforced existing city branding, mobilizing a growing network of actors towards the development of a smart region. Further research is needed to investigate this and other smart city developments, the significance of different smart city narratives, and how power relationships are reinforced and constructed through them Purpose: This paper investigates the mutually advantageous value-driven innovations brought by Universities as a key actor in the development of innovation exploiting Smart City opportunities. The final aim is to under-stand the role, tasks and contribution of Universities in Smart City pro-jects. Methodology: The study followed an exploratory and qualitative meth-odology and consisted of 44 in-depth semi-structured interviews with Smart City experts. The choice of the respondents was adjusted to approve the direct and indirect effect of developing the smart ecosystem in various organizational multistakeholder environments. Results: The study found three main areas in which Universities may con-tribute to Smart City projects: a) knowledge/technology creation and transfer; b) social/societal involvement; c) ecosystem facilita-tor/networking.Implications: This paper offers several implications for different stake-holders such as policy makers, Universities’ top managers and firms. Impli-cations for policy managers imply the change in the approach to consumers because most of them do not understand why they need smart solutions. Moreover, it highlights that bureaucracy and lack of an innovative mental-ity kill smart city projects, so the governmental structures should be wired first. Finally, it calls for a huge financial platform (incentives and new fi-nancial mechanisms) and legal changes (legal frameworks should be aligned with peculiarities of Smart Cities).Implications for top managers of Universities are related to the rethink of Universities in smart city innovation ecosystems with the possibility to play an active role. Implications for MNEs and SMEs include that Univer-sities may help in understanding the opportunities around Smart City initi-atives (there is often opacity on the return of investments). At the same time, Universities may help in dealing with public governments and local stakeholders (public and private) Global trends towards urbanisation are associated with wide-ranging challenges and opportunities for cities. Smart technologies create new opportunities for a range of smart city development and regeneration programmes designed to address the environmental, economic and social challenges concentrated in cities. Whilst smart city programmes have received much publicity, there has been much less discussion about the evaluation and measurement of smart city programme outcomes. Existing evaluation approaches have been criticised as non-standard and inadequate, focusing more on implementation processes and investment metrics than on city outcomes and the impacts of smart city programmes. Addressing this, the SmartDframe project aimed to examine city approaches to the evaluation of smart city projects and programmes and reporting of their impacts on city outcomes. A number of ‘smarter’ UK cities were invited to participate, with agreement by city authorities from Birmingham, Bristol, Manchester, Milton Keynes and Peterborough to be interviewed about their smart city work. The findings provide a series of smart city case studies that exemplify contemporary city practices, offering a timely, insightful contribution to city discourse about existing and best practice approaches to evaluation and reporting of complex smart city projects and programmes In a rapidly changing socio-technical environment cities are increasingly seen as main drivers for change. Against this backdrop, this paper studies the emerging Urban Living Lab and Smart City concepts from a project based perspective, by assessing a series of five Smart City initiatives within one local city ecosystem. A conceptual and analytical framework is used to analyse the architecture, nature and outcomes of the Smart City Ghent and the role of Urban Living Labs. The results of our analysis highlight the potential for social value creation and urban transition. However, current Smart City initiatives face the challenge of evolving from demonstrators towards real sustainable value. Furthermore, Smart Cities often have a technological deterministic, project-based approach, which forecloses a sustainable, permanent and growing future for the project outcomes. ‘City-governed’ Urban Living Labs have an interesting potential to overcome some of the identified challenges	['8054632', '43469724', '30333159', '8080179', '43351819', '8061614', '31245803']	[[{'name': 'Caird, Sally'}, {'name': 'Hudson, Lorraine'}, {'name': 'Kortuem, Gerd'}], [{'name': 'Bonetto, Riccardo'}, {'name': 'Rossi, Michele'}], [{'name': 'Bisegna, Fabio'}, {'name': 'Burattini, Chiara'}, {'name': 'Cellucci, Lucia'}, {'name': 'DE LIETO VOLLARO, Andrea'}, {'name': 'Drakou, DIONYSIA AIKATERINI'}, {'name': 'Golasi, Iacopo'}, {'name': 'Gugliermetti, Franco'}, {'name': 'Salata, Ferdinando'}], [{'name': 'Alan-Miguel Valdez'}, {'name': 'Albino V'}, {'name': 'Bakıcı T'}, {'name': 'Bell S'}, {'name': 'Berkhout F'}, {'name': 'Boltanski L'}, {'name': 'Borup M'}, {'name': 'Braun V'}, {'name': 'Cairns S'}, {'name': 'Carvalho M'}, {'name': 'Clapson M'}, {'name': 'Cordella A'}, {'name': 'Deakin M'}, {'name': 'd’Aquin M'}, {'name': 'Edwards M'}, {'name': 'European Platform for Intelligent Cities'}, {'name': 'Finnegan R'}, {'name': 'Franklin J'}, {'name': 'Gooch D'}, {'name': 'Greenfield A'}, {'name': 'Hienerth C'}, {'name': 'Hollands RG'}, {'name': 'Hollands RG'}, {'name': 'Jasanoff S'}, {'name': 'Kitchin R'}, {'name': 'Lee JH'}, {'name': 'Llewelyn-Davies W'}, {'name': 'Martinez-Balleste A'}, {'name': 'Matthew Cook'}, {'name': 'Miles MB'}, {'name': 'Neirotti P'}, {'name': 'Phaal R'}, {'name': 'Pink S'}, {'name': 'Shapiro JM'}, {'name': 'Shelton T'}, {'name': 'Stephen Potter'}, {'name': 'Söderström O'}, {'name': 'Townsend AM'}, {'name': 'Velaga NR'}, {'name': 'Vilajosana I'}, {'name': 'Von Hippel E'}, {'name': 'Wiig A'}], [{'name': 'Belyaeva, Z.'}, {'name': 'Ferraris, A.'}], [{'name': 'Caird, S.'}, {'name': 'Hudson, L.'}, {'name': 'Kortuem, G.'}], [{'name': 'Baccarne, Bastiaan'}, {'name': 'De Marez, Lieven'}, {'name': 'Mechant, Peter'}, {'name': 'Schuurman, Dimitri'}]]	['A Tale of Evaluation and Reporting in UK Smart Cities', 'Smart Grid for the Smart City', 'Urban lighting project for a small town: comparing citizens and authority benefits', 'Roadmaps to Utopia: Tales of the Smart City', 'Universities multistakeholder contribution to smart city ecosystem development', 'Communication on Smart City Evaluation and Reporting In UK cities: Pilots, Demos and Experiments Case', 'The role of urban living labs in a smart city']	7.0	exploratory	0.5
882f6d9e-3af8-49b7-80ff-c8fb7df06e72	addiction	"As new media are becoming daily fare, Internet addiction appears as a potential problem in adolescents. From the reported negative consequences, it appears that Internet addiction can have a variety of detrimental outcomes for young people that may require professional intervention. Researchers have now identified a number of activities and personality traits associated with Internet addiction. This study aimed to synthesise previous findings by (i) assessing the prevalence of potential Internet addiction in a large sample of adolescents, and (ii) investigating the interactions between personality traits and the usage of particular Internet applications as risk factors for Internet addiction. A total of 3,105 adolescents in the Netherlands filled out a self-report questionnaire including the Compulsive Internet Use Scale and the Quick Big Five Scale. Results indicate that 3.7% of the sample were classified as potentially being addicted to the Internet. The use of online gaming and social applications (online social networking sites and Twitter) increased the 2 risk for Internet addiction, whereas extraversion and conscientiousness appeared as protective factors in high frequency online gamers. The findings support the inclusion of 'Internet addiction' in the DSM-V. Vulnerability and resilience appear as significant aspects that require consideration in further studies Since the end of the eighties the Becker and Murphy model of rational addiction has been the dominant approach to estimate addiction e ects. The main implication of the model is that public policy, in principle, should not interfere with a fully rational behaviour. However, the additional public health care costs smokers impose on non smokers could be internalised using price mechanisms, as the long run price elasticity of demand is supposed to be, according to this model, significantly higher than the short run one and higher than that obtained from alternative models of addiction, such as the habit persistence model. In this paper we estimate the demand for Tobacco and related products in Italy using PANEL data supplied by ISTAT for the twenty Italian regions. The rational addiction model is used to estimate addiction e ects following the methodological approach suggested by Baltagi and Levin (2001). The myopic addiction model is also estimated as an alternative way of modelling addiction e ects. These data seem to support the rational addiction model, although the results are not clearcut. We have thus estimated the same models using Time Series of per-capita Households Tobacco expenditures from the Italian National Accounts. In this case, the data strongly support the Rational Addiction model and produce elasticities in line with similar case studies. Substance addiction is damaging to the health of persons, families, and society. Often the person with addiction has decreased spirituality and religiosity and suffers from anxiety, depression, or both, increasing the risk for continued substance use and its concomitant negative consequences. The study purpose was to describe spirituality and religiosity, among persons enrolled in methadone maintenance therapy and to examine associations between spirituality, religiosity, anxiety, depression, and drug-use consequences. Using a descriptive and cross-sectional correlational design, 108 participants completed questionnaires assessing the study variables. Spiritual well-being was similar to other addiction samples and lower than healthy person samples. Most participants described themselves as spiritual or religious though religious participation was lower than in their past. The analysis indicated that spirituality, religiosity, depression, anxiety, and negative drug-use consequences are interrelated in the person with addiction. Higher anxiety was predictive of negative drug-use consequences Internet usage has grown exponentially over the last decade. Research indicates that excessive Internet use can lead to symptoms associated with addiction. To date, assessment of potential Internet addiction has varied regarding populations studied and instruments used, making reliable prevalence estimations difficult. To overcome the present problems a preliminary study was conducted testing a parsimonious Internet addiction components model based on Griffiths’ addiction components (Journal of Substance Use, 10, 191–197, 2005), including salience, mood modification, tolerance, withdrawal, conflict, and relapse. Two validated measures of Internet addiction were used (Compulsive Internet Use Scale [CIUS], Meerkerk et al. in Cyberpsychology & Behavior, 12(1), 1–6, 2009, and Assessment for Internet and Computer Game Addiction Scale [AICA-S], Wölfling et al. 2010) in two independent samples (ns = 3,105 and 2,257). The fit of the model was analysed using Confirmatory Factor Analysis. Results indicate that the Internet addiction components model fits the data in both samples well. The two sample/two instrument approach provides converging evidence concerning the degree to which the components model can organize the self-reported behavioural components of Internet addiction. Recommendations for future research include a more detailed assessment of tolerance as addiction componen Finding the genetic markers that influence complex, multigenic substance addiction phenotypes has been an area of significant medical study. Understanding complex disease traits like addiction has been hampered by the lack of functional insights into novel variants to the human genome. We hypothesized that gene location plays a role in functional genomic neighborhoods.
To test whether there is a relationship between opiate, dopamine, and GABA disease and population allele frequencies, we used genes obtained from addiction literature curated by the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI). These addiction and metabolism focused search terms generated opiate, dopamine, and GABA addiction results (N=587 genes). These genes were then projected onto the genome to identify cluster regions of genetic importance for substance addiction. Clusters were defined as regions of the genome with more than six genes within a 1.5Mb linear genomic window. We identified seven hotspots located on chromosomes 4, 6 (2 clusters), 10, 11, and 19. Human polymorphism data was surveyed from the 1148 individuals comprising the 11 sample populations of the HapMap Project dataset. Our analyses demonstrate that when human populations are assessed, ten candidate addiction alleles were identified. Finally assessments of public genome wide association studies show long range linkages to canonical addiction genes. This study delineates a novel method to identify novel candidate addiction variants using a systems biology approach that relies on an interdisciplinary set of data, including genomic, pathway data, and population variation. Important connections to sociological and environmental data are discussed to contextualize addiction data In light of the abundance of studies focusing on the genetic contributions to addiction, Morse develops a meaningful background on the legal and scientific images of behavior, the disease concept of addiction, and the aspects of addiction for which a person may be held legally accountable Drug addiction implicates both reward learning and homeostatic regulation mechanisms of the brain. This has stimulated 2 partially successful theoretical perspectives on addiction. Many important aspects of addiction, however, remain to be explained within a single, unified framework that integrates the 2 mechanisms. Building upon a recently developed homeostatic reinforcement learning theory, the authors focus on a key transition stage of addiction that is well modeled in animals, escalation of drug use, and propose a computational theory of cocaine addiction where cocaine reinforces behavior due to its rapid homeostatic corrective effect, whereas its chronic use induces slow and long-lasting changes in homeostatic setpoint. Simulations show that our new theory accounts for key behavioral and neurobiological features of addiction, most notably, escalation of cocaine use, drug-primed craving and relapse, individual differences underlying dose-response curves, and dopamine D2-receptor downregulation in addicts. The theory also generates unique predictions about cocaine self-administration behavior in rats that are confirmed by new experimental results. Viewing addiction as a homeostatic reinforcement learning disorder coherently explains many behavioral and neurobiological aspects of the transition to cocaine addiction, and suggests a new perspective toward understanding addiction In the past decade, research has accumulated suggesting that excessive Internet use can lead to the development of a behavioral addiction. Internet addiction has been considered as a serious threat to mental health and the excessive use of the Internet has been linked to a variety of negative psychosocial consequences. The aim of this review is to identify all empirical studies to date that used neuroimaging techniques to shed light upon the emerging mental health problem of Internet and gaming addiction from a neuroscientific perspective. Neuroimaging studies offer an advantage over traditional survey and behavioral research because with this method, it is possible to distinguish particular brain areas that are involved in the development and maintenance of addiction. A systematic literature search was conducted, identifying 18 studies. These studies provide compelling evidence for the similarities between different types of addictions, notably substance-related addictions and Internet and gaming addiction, on a variety of levels. On the molecular level, Internet addiction is characterized by an overall reward deficiency that entails decreased dopaminergic activity. On the level of neural circuitry, Internet and gaming addiction led to neuroadaptation and structural changes that occur as a consequence of prolonged increased activity in brain areas associated with addiction. On a behavioral level, Internet and gaming addicts appear to be constricted with regards to their cognitive functioning in various domains. The paper shows that understanding the neuronal correlates associated with the development of Internet and gaming addiction will promote future research and will pave the way for the development of addiction treatment approaches The last decade has witnessed a large increase in research on the newly emerging mental health problem of Internet addiction. Rather than looking at Internet addiction per se, this study focused on particular activities on the Internet that might be potentially addictive and linked them to personality traits that might predispose individuals to Internet addiction. The aims of this study were (i) to assess the prevalence of clinically significant levels of Internet addiction, and to (ii) discern the interplay between personality traits and specific Internet uses in increasing the risk for Internet addiction. This cross-sectional online survey used data from 2,257 students of an English university. Results indicated that 3.2% of the students were classified as being addicted to the Internet. The included personality traits and uses of online activities explained 21.5% of the variance in Internet addiction. A combination of online shopping and neuroticism decreased the risk for Internet addiction, whereas a combination of online gaming and openness to experience increased it. In addition to this, frequent usage of online shopping and social online activities, high neuroticism and low agreeableness significantly increased the chances of being addicted to the Internet. Findings and their implications are discussed This article examines Easyway, a popular clinical and self-help method for the treatment of smoking addiction established by the late Allen Carr in 1984. It begins by addressing how smoking has come to be constituted as a neuropharmacological addiction and some of the issues and concerns raised against this in the social sciences. After situating its theoretical and empirical focus, the article then proceeds with an interpretative thematic analysis of a selection of Easyway self-help texts. The aims here are as follows: firstly, to show how Easyway, as a discourse, constitutes the problem of nicotine addiction in novel and distinctive ways; secondly, to elaborate how the Easyway texts seek to govern readers – paradoxically, through their free capacity for reflection, introspection and action – to overcome their situated addiction to smoking; and thirdly, to identify and locate the significance of the author’s implicit claims to charisma in underpinning his authority to know and treat nicotine addiction In the last decade, Internet usage has grown tremendously on a global scale. The increasing popularity and frequency of Internet use has led to an increasing number of reports highlighting the potential negative consequences of overuse. Over the last decade, research into Internet addiction has proliferated. This paper reviews the existing 68 epidemiological studies of Internet addiction that (i) contain quantitative empirical data, (ii) have been published after 2000, (iii) include an analysis relating to Internet addiction, (iv) include a minimum of 1000 participants, and (v) provide a full-text article published in English using the database Web of Science. Assessment tools and conceptualisations, prevalence, and associated factors in adolescents and adults are scrutinised. The results reveal the following. First, no gold standard of Internet addiction classification exists as 21 different assessment instruments have been identified. They adopt official criteria for substance use disorders or pathological gambling, no or few criteria relevant for an addiction diagnosis, time spent online, or resulting problems. Second, reported prevalence rates differ as a consequence of different assessment tools and cut-offs, ranging from 0.8% in Italy to 26.7% in Hong Kong. Third, Internet addiction is associated with a number of sociodemographic, Internet use, and psychosocial factors, as well as comorbid symptoms and disorder in adolescents and adults. The results indicate that a number of core symptoms (i.e., compulsive use, negative outcomes and salience) appear relevant for diagnosis, which assimilates Internet addiction and other addictive disorders and also differentiates them, implying a conceptualisation as syndrome with similar etiology and components, but different expressions of addictions. Limitations include the exclusion of studies with smaller sample sizes and studies focusing on specific online behaviours. Conclusively, there is a need for nosological precision so that ultimately those in need can be helped by translating the scientific evidence established in the context of Internet addiction into actual clinical practice Summarizes survey results on how Americans view alcohol and drug addiction, including whether it is a personal weakness or an illness; their experiences with addiction; common treatments; and support for state tax increases to improve treatment programs"	['7794058', '3034484', '41649548', '7794676', '40106485', '41659040', '34145702', '8015199', '7793487', '7793835', '18521513', '7793545', '36990117']	[[{'name': 'Griffiths, MD'}, {'name': 'Kuss, DJ'}, {'name': 'Shorter, GW'}, {'name': 'Van de Mheen, D'}, {'name': 'Van Rooij, AJ'}], [{'name': 'Silvia Tiezzi'}], [{'name': 'Piacentine, Linda B.'}], [{'name': 'Griffiths, Mark D.'}, {'name': 'Kuss, D.J.'}, {'name': 'Schoenmakers, Tim M.'}, {'name': 'Shorter, Gillian W.'}, {'name': 'van Rooij, Antonius J.'}], [{'name': 'Jackson, Latifa F.'}], [{'name': 'Canavan, Gerry'}], [{'name': 'Morse, Stephen J.'}], [{'name': 'Durand, A.'}, {'name': 'Girardeau, P.'}, {'name': 'Gutkin, B.'}, {'name': 'Keramati, M.'}, {'name': 'Serge, A.'}], [{'name': 'Adalier'}, {'name': 'Bailey'}, {'name': 'Beck'}, {'name': 'Beutel'}, {'name': 'Birmaher'}, {'name': 'Brebner'}, {'name': 'Chen'}, {'name': 'Costa'}, {'name': 'Craven'}, {'name': 'Derogatis'}, {'name': 'Descartes'}, {'name': 'Dong'}, {'name': 'First'}, {'name': 'Ge'}, {'name': 'Goldstein'}, {'name': 'Grant'}, {'name': 'Han'}, {'name': 'Hoeft'}, {'name': 'Hou'}, {'name': 'Huang'}, {'name': 'Huettel'}, {'name': 'Ko'}, {'name': 'Koepp'}, {'name': 'Koob'}, {'name': 'Le Bihan'}, {'name': 'Lebcrubier'}, {'name': 'Lee'}, {'name': 'Lemmens'}, {'name': 'Lin'}, {'name': 'Lin'}, {'name': 'Littel'}, {'name': 'Liu'}, {'name': 'Luck'}, {'name': 'Niedermeyer'}, {'name': 'Pavlov'}, {'name': 'Prochaska'}, {'name': 'Repovš'}, {'name': 'Sheehan'}, {'name': 'Skinner'}, {'name': 'Tao'}, {'name': 'Tao'}, {'name': 'Thomas'}, {'name': 'Van Rooij'}, {'name': 'Volkow'}, {'name': 'Wang'}, {'name': 'Wilson'}, {'name': 'Yang'}, {'name': 'Yi'}, {'name': 'Young'}, {'name': 'Young'}, {'name': 'Yuan'}, {'name': 'Zhou'}], [{'name': 'Binder, JF'}, {'name': 'Griffiths, MD'}, {'name': 'Kuss, DJ'}], [{'name': 'Marron, Donncha'}], [{'name': 'Billieux, J'}, {'name': 'Griffiths, MD'}, {'name': 'Karila, L'}, {'name': 'Kuss, DJ'}], [{'name': 'Deanna Lewis'}]]	['Internet addiction in adolescents: prevalence and risk factors', 'Addiction and Smoking Behaviour in Italy', 'Spirituality, Religiosity, Depression, Anxiety, and Drug-Use Consequences During Methadone Maintenance Therapy', 'Assessing Internet Addiction Using the Parsimonious Internet Addiction Components Model—A Preliminary Study', 'A Novel Bioinformatic Approach to Understanding Addiction', 'Addiction', 'Addiction, Genetics, and Criminal Responsibility', 'Cocaine Addiction as a Homeostatic Reinforcement Learning Disorder', 'Internet and gaming addiction: a systematic literature review of neuroimaging studies', 'Internet addiction in students: prevalence and risk factors', 'Stop smoking the Easyway:addiction, self-help and tobacco cessation', 'Internet addiction: a systematic review of epidemiological research for the last decade', 'What Does America Think About Addiction Prevention and Treatment?']	13.0	exploratory	0.5

98c531da-8acc-4782-953a-c7a01d1fb384	financial literacy	"There is ample empirical evidence documenting widespread financial illiteracy and limited pension knowledge. At the same time, the distribution of wealth is widely dispersed and many workers arrive on the verge of retirement with few or no personal assets. In this paper, we investigate the relationship between financial literacy and household net worth, relying on comprehensive measures of financial knowledge designed for a special module of the DNB (De Nederlandsche Bank) Household Survey. Our findings provide evidence of a strong positive association between financial literacy and net worth, even after controlling for many determinants of wealth. Moreover, we discuss two channels through which financial literacy might facilitate wealth accumulation. First, financial knowledge increases the likelihood of investing in the stock market, allowing individuals to benefit from the equity premium. Second, financial literacy is positively related to retirement planning, and the development of a savings plan has been shown to boost wealth. Overall, financial literacy, both directly and indirectly, is found to have a strong link to household wealth. JEL Classification: D91, D12, J26 Keywords: Financial Education, Savings and Wealth Accumulation, Retirement Preparation, Knowledge of Finance and Economics, Overconfidence, Stock Market Participatio 'Financial literacy', as a concept by that name, has only been explored in library science literature for a little over a decade.  The concept, and especially the role of libraries in furthering this literacy, is still evolving.  This systematic literature review examines the current definition of 'financial literacy', why financial literacy matters, where the public has been accessing financial literacy education to date, the difficulties encountered, by libraries and others, in providing this education, and how these challenges might be addressed moving forward.Publisher does not allow open access until after publicatio Is financial literacy a substitute or complement for financial advice? We analyze the decision by consumers to seek financial advice in the form of credit counseling. Credit counseling is an important component of the consumer credit sector for consumers facing debt problems. Our analysis accounts for the endogeneity of an individual’s financial situation to financial literacy, and the endogeneity of financial literacy to exposure to credit counseling. Results show counseling substitutes for financial literacy. Individuals with better literacy are 60% less likely to use credit counseling. These results suggest that credit counseling provides a safety 

net for poor financial literacy The global financial crisis has intensified the problems of over-indebtedness, especially for the poor. In this context, the microfinance industry is giving more attention to building their customers’ financial capabilities, designing products that respond to their needs and preferences, and ensuring their protection as consumers. In a world where financial products and institutions are expanding rapidly, deciding which services to choose and how to use them is an increasing challenge. That challenge is especially great for customers who are poor and have limited experience in the formal financial sector. While money-management strategies can be innovative, the financial choices they make are defined by environments where informal financial practices are dominant and the consumer is often uncertain about commercial products and services. In increasingly complex and competitive financial markets, consumers with low levels of financial literacy lack the information and tools necessary to make informed decisions. Building financial capabilities can help people move from being overwhelmed by their financial options to being empowered by them.Education, Financial literacy, global financial crisis, Microfinance,"	['6102678', '39546796', '8035812', '2500775']	[[{'name': 'Alessie, Rob'}, {'name': 'Lusardi, Annamaria'}, {'name': 'Rooij, Maarten van'}], [{'name': 'Faulkner, Ash'}], [{'name': 'Amemiya'}, {'name': 'Bernheim'}, {'name': 'Bernheim'}, {'name': 'Collins'}, {'name': 'JOHN GATHERGOOD'}, {'name': 'JÖRG WEBER'}, {'name': 'RICHARD DISNEY'}, {'name': 'Staten'}], [{'name': 'Cohen, Monique'}]]	['Financial literacy, retirement planning, and household wealth', 'A Systematic Review of Financial Literacy as a Termed Concept: More Questions Than Answers', 'Credit counseling: a substitute for consumer financial literacy?', 'Financial literacy']	4.0	exploratory	0.5

The nature and use of biotechnology crops are described and related to aspects of food security. Biotechnological applications for food and animal feed are described, together with trends on global adoption of these crops. The benefits of biotechnology crops through increased yield, reduced pesticide use and decreased environmental damage are discussed. Examples of biotechnology crops which do not involve genetic modification are also described. Applications of biotechnology to drought and salt tolerance, and biofortification in which micronutrient content is enhanced are discussed. Emergent technologies such as RNA spraying technology, use of genome editing in agriculture and future targets for improved food and environmental security are considered This paper reviews the status of Agricultural Biotechnology in Sub-Saharan Africa. It addresses the potential economic benefits to Sub-Saharan Africa and the effect biotechnology policies may have on growth, production and poverty reduction. The extent to which agricultural biotechnology will compound or mitigate the constraints faced by smallholders/subsistence farmers is also discussed. The status of crop biotechnology research worldwide is reviewed and the influence of intellectual property rights (IPRs) and market concentration on the development and diffusion of biotechnology in Sub-Saharan Africa is analyzed. The paper also explores the potential of public-private partnerships and recommends policy measures and investments that could focus more biotechnology research on the problems of the poor and alleviate some of the concerns about the impacts of biotechnology.Policy Options; Intellectual Property; Biotechnology; Sub-Saharan Africa; Technology Diffusion The results of a study conducted by the Center for Space and Advanced Technology (CSAT) for NASA-JSC are presented. The objectives were to determine the interests and attitudes of the U.S. biotechnology industry toward space biotechnology and to prepare a concise review of the current activities of the biotechnology industry. In order to accomplish these objectives, two primary actions were taken. First, a questionnaire was designed, reviewed, and distributed to U.S. biotechnology companies. Second, reviews of the various biotechnology fields were prepared in several aspects of the industry. For each review, leading figures in the field were asked to prepare a brief review pointing out key trends and current industry technical problems. The result is a readable narrative of the biotechnology industry which will provide space scientists and engineers valuable clues as to where the space environment can be explored to advance the U.S. biotechnology industry The past twenty years have witnessed the high-speed growth of China’s biotechnology industry, and this presents an excellent opportunity to examine the changes that have taken place, especially, to carry out overall evaluation and governance  analysis  from the perspective of technology policies. Although China’s biotechnology industry has achieved tremendous extension both in scale and structure, the strengths it gained from basic research have been significantly weakened by commercialization. This has resulted in the comparatively limited scale of the  whole industry, innovation-lacking products, poor output from research and development and scarcity of industrial resources. A large range of literature regarding China’s biotechnology industry attributes these outcomes to  vague and even inappropriate governance, findings supported mainly  by analyses based on the linear model of impact of government policies  on industrial development. In these analyses, government, enterprises and companies  as well as R&D organizations are either put on the opposite poles or in a straight line. 

After examining the nature of China’s biotechnology industry,  and in particular  the dynamic procedures in research and development, the authors of this  paper argue that besides government, enterprises and R&D organizations, a diverse array of factors should be taken into account as we tackle issues emerging in understanding  the development of China’s biotechnology industry. Furthermore, these factors, human or nonhuman, should not be arranged as opposing poles or linearly connected points on a straight line. They are in fact all knitted in networks and act as both knitters and knots. 

China’s biotechnology industry gains its strength to develop and  evolve from these networks, thus its governance must be aimed at improving their stability and quality.

Although the main disciplinary perspectives of this research are historical and sociological (including identification of the three development stages of biotechnology in China since 1978 to present days), a large number of concepts and ideas from management studies as well as an interdisciplinary approach are also incorporated into the analysis. 

The main model used  in this research is Actor Network Theory, which is employed as a basic theoretical frame.  From this starting point the authors  attempt to make a closer examination of China’s biotechnology industry both at the level of technology research and development and at the level of commercialization. The modeling process in this research can be regarded as an attempt to explore the social construction of China’s biotechnology industry. The  paper reveals how China’s biotechnology industry develops in  the form of networks  within  the country’s social context and what kinds of relationships exist among  the  relevant  factors; therefore, providing guiding insights for improving  the governance of China’s biotechnology industry both in policy and management The article discusses the development of New Zealand's Biotechnology Learning Hub. The authors explains the Biotechnology Learning Hub is an on-line portal developed as a result of initial findings. Its principal aim is to bring the biotechnology and education sectors together in a more sustainable way. The author outlines classroom studies, meetings with the Biotechnolgy industry, and the features of the hub The African continent has considerable potential to reap the benefits associated with modern agricultural biotechnology. Plant biotechnology and breeding represent an invaluable toolbox to face the challenges of African agriculture, such as food and nutrition security, environment protection, soil fertility, and crop adaptation to new climatic conditions. As Africa has only relatively recently adopted agricultural biotechnology, it has the opportunity to harness the immense knowledge gathered over the last two decades while avoiding some of the difficulties experienced by early adopters. High-level research and education systems together with a specific regulatory framework are critical elements in the development of sustainable biotechnology-based agriculture and industry. The more actors that are involved in Research & Development applied to nutritionally and important local crops, the faster Africa will generate its future African innovators. Here, we discuss the contribution of plant biotechnology to a transformative African agriculture that combines intensification of land productivity and environmental sustainability AgrEvo is a German producer of crop protection products. In 1995 it made the strategic decision to shift from crop protection to crop production, with the help of biotechnology. It acquired Plant Genetic Systems (PGS), a successful plant biotechnology company, and started a round of acquisitions in the international seed industry. The company soon found out that biotechnology brings many new uncertainties in strategic decision-making.Includes bibliographical reference The promise of agricultural biotechnology has become reality. Foods produced through biotechnology will become increasingly common in the food production and distribution system. Consumer reaction to these foods will be an important factor in determining the ultimate success of the biotechnology enterprise. This paper reviews trends in U.S. consumers' awareness and acceptance of biotechnology. Results of several national surveys show that biotechnology has not been an issue for the vast majority of consumers. Most have a positive attitude about biotechnology. This paper also presents some implications for future research and educational programs.Consumer/Household Economics, Research and Development/Tech Change/Emerging Technologies, Environmental biotechnology exploits living organisms (plant, bacteria, fungi, etc) in various applications of waste treatment and remediation of pollutants. The organisms that demonstrate the potential to utilize the wastes or pollutants as food are naturally found in the environment. Rapid development in genetic technology also assists in introducing genetically modified organisms with enhanced capability to degrade wastes or pollutants. It has been proven that environmental biotechnology can provide safer methods of cleaning hazardous wastes compared to conventional methods since it uses natural agents. Finally the utilization of biowastes and organic residues to useful value added product were also studie"	['8754915', '2706431', '24874275', '25514409', '15108300', '78227633', '17518086', '2901137', '31016494']	[[{'name': 'Gartland, Jill S.'}, {'name': 'Gartland, Kevan'}], [{'name': 'Yawson, Ivy'}, {'name': 'Yawson, Robert M.'}], [{'name': 'Johnston, Richard S.'}, {'name': 'Norton, David J.'}, {'name': 'Tom, Baldwin H.'}], [{'name': 'Hong, J.'}, {'name': 'Marinova, D.'}, {'name': 'Wang, K.'}, {'name': 'Zhu, L.'}], [{'name': 'Buntting, Catherine Michelle'}, {'name': 'Jones, Alister'}], [{'name': 'De Bauw, Vanessa'}, {'name': 'De Buck, Sylvie'}, {'name': 'De Oliveira, Dulce'}, {'name': 'Diasolua Ngudi, Delphin'}, {'name': 'Gheysen, Godelieve'}, {'name': 'Heijde, Marc'}, {'name': 'Lambein, Fernand'}, {'name': 'Travella, Silvia'}, {'name': 'Van Montagu, Marc'}], [{'name': 'Bijman, J.'}], [{'name': 'Hoban, Thomas J.'}], [{'name': 'Faculty of Biotechnology & Biomolecular Sciences, Environmental Biotechnology Research Group'}]]	['Contributions of biotechnology to meeting future food and environmental security needs', 'Policy options of agricultural biotechnology R&D in Sub-Saharan Africa: key issues and aspects', 'Space and biotechnology: An industry profile', 'Analysis on the evolution and governance of the biotechnology industry of China', 'Developing a biotechnology learning hub for New Zealand', 'Scientific innovation for the sustainable development of African agriculture', 'AgrEvo: From crop protection to crop production', 'TRENDS IN CONSUMER ACCEPTANCE AND AWARENESS OF BIOTECHNOLOGY', 'Environmental Biotechnology Research Group: Research Report.']	9.0	navigational	0.8198360296441437
f400a12b-108c-493a-8320-cb7ffd06115c	serpentes	Number of Pages: 9Integrative BiologyGeological Science Developmental processes and their results, morphological characters, are inherited through transmission of genes regulating development. While there is ample evidence that cis-regulatory elements tend to be modular, with sequence segments dedicated to different roles, the situation for proteins is less clear, being particularly complex for transcription factors with multiple functions. Some motifs mediating protein-protein interactions may be exclusive to particular developmental roles, but it is also possible that motifs are mostly shared among different processes. Here we focus on HoxA13, a protein essential for limb development. We asked whether the HoxA13 amino acid sequence evolved similarly in three limbless clades: Gymnophiona, Amphisbaenia and Serpentes. We explored variation in ω (dN/dS) using a maximum-likelihood framework and HoxA13sequences from 47 species. Comparisons of evolutionary models provided low ω global values and no evidence that HoxA13 experienced relaxed selection in limbless clades. Branch-site models failed to detect evidence for positive selection acting on any site along branches of Amphisbaena and Gymnophiona, while three sites were identified in Serpentes. Examination of alignments did not reveal consistent sequence differences between limbed and limbless species. We conclude that HoxA13 has no modules exclusive to limb development, which may be explained by its involvement in multiple developmental processes Number of Pages: 2Integrative BiologyGeological Science Number of Pages: 4Integrative BiologyGeological Science Number of Pages: 4Integrative BiologyGeological Science Number of Pages: 8Integrative BiologyGeological Science Number of Pages: 4Integrative BiologyGeological Science	['33911262', '8663895', '39828543', '33912210', '33914728', '33897250', '33902656']	[[{'name': 'Chiszar, David'}, {'name': 'Smith, Hobart M.'}], [{'name': 'Bamshad M'}, {'name': 'Bell MA'}, {'name': 'Brakefield PM'}, {'name': 'Brakefield PM'}, {'name': 'Brayer KJ'}, {'name': 'Cohn M'}, {'name': 'Crow KD'}, {'name': 'Delport W'}, {'name': 'Di-Poï N'}, {'name': 'Dollé P'}, {'name': 'Dollé P'}, {'name': 'Fromental-Ramain C'}, {'name': 'Galant R'}, {'name': 'Gans C'}, {'name': 'Goodman FR'}, {'name': 'Gower DJ'}, {'name': 'Graur D'}, {'name': 'Günter P.
